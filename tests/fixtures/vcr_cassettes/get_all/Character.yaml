        resides in the town of Rosen where he acts as the regent.<\/p>\n<p>He is a
        32 year old human, of calculating and restrained spirit.<\/p>\n<p>A proven
        fighter, he has won many tournaments, including against princes and kings
        of other realms. People find him somewhat cold, but think he''ll be a good
        and just next King.<\/p>\n<p>He was married to Helena von Weisshaffen and
        has 2 boys with her before discovering that the children were those of Harald
        of House Pyre. Helena and Harald were exiled and have returned to Whitehaven.<\/p>\n<p>He
        married Lady <a href=\"https:\/\/kanka.io\/en-US\/campaign\/1\/characters\/4121\"

        Pyre<\/a> of House Pyre, sister of Harald, in 1024 AC.<\/p>\n<h3>Inspiration<\/h3>\n<p>Mathos
        is very similar to Stanis Baratheon. He is calculating, is goal oriented,
        loves his family but can sometimes seem cold. He does everything he can to
        strengthen the kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>He believes his father isn''t managing the
        situation properly. He is still angry that Myria wasn''t married off to secure
        an alliance, but instead was allowed to take the vows of celibacy. He''s also
        been pressuring his parents to marry off Hildegard to re-secure the alliance
        with Rivandol. He sees Hildegard''s flaws in her actions (fighting, bringing
        shame to the family name), but realises that the people love her for being
        close to them.<\/p>\n<p>Matheos and Hildegard haven''t meet since the birth
        of his first son, Leonhard.<\/p>\n","image":"characters\/EWhsClPzJ9AkXbsC4QCV2Tky2idEk76rAqs039NK.jpeg","focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"image_full":"https:\/\/images.kanka.io\/user\/gJy-2iAAMMVEAjB1n6miOtMEObk=\/smart\/src\/characters%2FEWhsClPzJ9AkXbsC4QCV2Tky2idEk76rAqs039NK.jpeg?webpfallback","image_thumb":"https:\/\/images.kanka.io\/user\/31BB-f9WBg7hyybmz9Tiicr_A4A=\/40x40\/smart\/src\/characters%2FEWhsClPzJ9AkXbsC4QCV2Tky2idEk76rAqs039NK.jpeg?webpfallback","has_custom_image":true,"header_full":"","has_custom_header":false,"is_private":false,"is_template":false,"entity_id":12056,"tags":[],"created_at":"2018-04-03T19:32:30.000000Z","created_by":null,"updated_at":"2019-04-04T16:31:23.000000Z","updated_by":1,"location_id":5150,"title":"Heir

        einigen Jahren trug sich in den heruntergekommenen Randbezirken von ______________
        ein<br \/>tragisches Ereignis zu, das Dion niemals vergessen w\u00fcrde.<br
        \/>\u201eBeeil dich, Pelaios, sonst sind die besten Pl\u00e4tze weg!\u201c,
        rief ein junger Tiefling seinem kleinen Bruder<br \/>zu. Schnell versuchte
        der J\u00fcngere Akmenos aufzuholen. Doch als er merkte, dass dies kein Leichtes<br
        \/>war, beschloss er eine Abk\u00fcrzung zu nehmen und verschwand in einer
        dunklen Seitengasse, wo er<br \/>\u00fcber M\u00fcll und tote Ratten h\u00fcpfen
        musste. Sein vor Aufregung wedelnder Schweif schlug immer<br \/>wieder gegen
        die Hausw\u00e4nde in dem engen Durchgang. Er war erst acht Jahre alt und
        hatte das Ding,<br \/>das er hinter sich her schleifte noch nicht so unter
        Kontrolle, wie Akmenos, der fast doppelt so alt<br \/>war, wie er. Pelaios
        konnte das helle Licht am anderen Ende schon sehen und als er auf die Stra\u00dfe<br
        \/>stolperte, rannte er direkt in eine gro\u00dfe Traube von Leuten, die sich
        hier versammelt hatte. \u201eAuch<br \/>schon da?\u201c, ert\u00f6nte es hinter
        dem kleinen Tiefling mit einem Hauch von \u00dcberheblichkeit. \u201eIch warte<br
        \/>hier schon seit Ewigkeiten.\u201c, sagte Akmenos und entbl\u00f6\u00dfte
        seinen scharfen Z\u00e4hne, als er so tat, als<br \/>w\u00fcrde er g\u00e4hnen.
        Die goldenen Augen des Kleineren stierten w\u00fctend in die Roten des anderen.
        \u201eTu<br \/>nicht so, als w\u00e4rst du schon seit Stunden hier.\u201c,
        sagte er beleidigt und verschr\u00e4nkte die Arme.<br \/>Akmenos grinste nur
        und wuschelte ihm durch das blutrote Haar. \u201e Na komm.\u201c Er lotste
        ihn in eine<br \/>Seitenstra\u00dfe, die genau so verwahrlost war, wie alles
        im Teufelsdorf.<br \/>So nannten die Menschen den Randbezirk, in den die Obrigkeit
        die anwohnenden Tieflinge<br \/>vor vielen Jahren versto\u00dfen hatte. Es
        war ein Ort voller Armut, Krankheit und einer hohen<br \/>Kriminalit\u00e4tsrate.
        Viele nahmen \u00fcber die Zeit die Verhaltensweisen an, die ihnen zugeschrieben<br
        \/>wurden. Warum sich sittlich verhalten, wenn man ohnehin in jedermanns Auge
        ein Monster war?<br \/>Die beiden Jungen kletterten an den grob aufeinander
        gesetzten Steine eines alten und eher<br \/>ruinenhaft aussehenden Hauses
        hoch. Akmenos reichte seinem Bruder die Hand und zog ihn auf das<br \/>Dach.
        Dort oben hatten sie die perfekt Sicht auf das, was sich auf der Stra\u00dfe
        unter ihnen abspielte.<br \/>Heute war ein besonderer Tag und alle Tieflinge
        aus dem Teufelsdorf versammelten sich, um der<br \/>Verlesung der versprochenen
        Besserungen f\u00fcr den Randbezirk zu lauschen. Der F\u00fcrst hatte ihnen<br
        \/>versprochen, dass mehr in den Hausbau und in die medizinische Versorgung
        investiert werden soll.<br \/>Auch sollen sie mehr Abgaben der Ernte erhalten
        und wie jeder in der Stadt normal arbeiten d\u00fcrfen.<br \/>- 1 -<br \/>F\u00fcr
        die Erf\u00fcllung dieser Forderungen haben viele Tieflinge gek\u00e4mpft,
        aber nie wurde etwas<br \/>unternommen. Doch heute sollte es soweit sein.<br
        \/>Von hier oben hatten die beiden Jungen den perfekten Ausblick auf den Marktplatz.
        Es ert\u00f6nte ein<br \/>Horn und alle K\u00f6pfe wandten sich in die Richtung,
        von wo der Klang herkam. Auf hohen R\u00f6ssern<br \/>mit sch\u00f6nen Decken,
        auf denen das Emblem des F\u00fcrsten in goldenen Lettern aufgestickt war,
        ritt die<br \/>Stadtwache, gefolgt von einer Kutsche und einem weiteren dutzend
        Wachen auf den gro\u00dfen Platz.<br \/>Ein stattlicher Soldat mit einer goldenen
        R\u00fcstung, nahm seinen Helm ab und zog eine<br \/>Pergamentrolle aus seinem
        G\u00fcrtel. \u201eSeid gegr\u00fc\u00dft! Heute ist der Tag aller Tage. Nach
        vielen Stunden<br \/>der Beratung und Verhandlung, kam der F\u00fcrst nun
        endlich zu einem Entschluss. Es sollen endlich<br \/>Taten folgen und Ver\u00e4nderungen
        in kraft treten.\u201c Er rollt das Papier zusammen und steckt es wieder<br
        \/>weg. Er hebt langsam die Hand, w\u00e4hrend alle anwesenden gespannt auf
        die Kutsche blicken und auf<br \/>das Heraustreten des Beraters warten. \u201eAngriff!\u201c,
        ruft der Soldat.<br \/>Von allen Seiten str\u00f6men Soldaten in die Stra\u00dfen
        und Gassen. Mit schwingenden Schwertern<br \/>und Lanzen stechen sie auf die
        nichts ahnenden Tieflinge ein, die mit der Hoffnung auf Besserung<br \/>hergekommen
        waren. Es ist ein riesiges Massaker. Alles wehren hilft nichts. Die Ver\u00e4nderungen,
        die<br \/>dem F\u00fcrsten vorschweben ist die Eliminierung und Ausrottung
        des Teufelsdorfs. Egal ob Mann oder<br \/>Frau, jung oder alt, alles was den
        Soldaten in ihre rot gesprenkelten Klinge l\u00e4uft, wird ausradiert.<br
        \/>Die beiden Jungen auf dem Dach m\u00fcssen fassungslos dem Szenario, das
        sich auf den rot<br \/>gef\u00e4rbten Stra\u00dfen abspielt, zusehen. Pelaios
        kann das nicht verstehen, in ihm breitet sich Leere aus,<br \/>er f\u00fchlt
        gar nichts. Es scheint alles so unwirklich, dass es nur ein Alptraum sein
        kann. Doch als<br \/>Akmenos ihn an seine Brust zieht und fest an sich dr\u00fcckt,
        dass ihm dieses Bild voll Grauen erspart<br \/>bleibt, wird ihm klar, dass
        es sich hierbei um die Realit\u00e4t handelt. Der F\u00fcrst hatte sich die
        Hoffnung<br \/>der Tieflinge zu nutzen gemacht, um diese schlie\u00dflich
        in ihrem Blut zu ertr\u00e4nken. Das Einzige, das<br \/>Pelaios wahrnahm waren
        die Schreie und der bei\u00dfende Gestank von Blut, der sich irgendwann mit<br
        \/>Rauch vermischte. Er wollte schreien und weinen, aber er konnte nicht...<br
        \/>Irgendwann wurde es still und die schweren Schritte der Soldaten verrieten,
        dass sie ihren<br \/>Auftrag erf\u00fcllt hatten und abzogen. Pelaios sp\u00fcrte
        die warme Hand seines Bruders auf seinem Kopf,<br \/>wie sie beruhigend durch
        seine Haare streichelte. \u201eWir m\u00fcssen uns ein sicheres Versteck suchen.\u201c,<br
        \/>fl\u00fcsterte er ihm ins Ohr. \u201eVersuch nur mich anzusehen, h\u00f6rst
        du?\u201c Der Kleinere nickte kaum<br \/>merklich und l\u00f6ste sich aus
        seinen Armen.<br \/>- 2 -<br \/>Schwach versuchte Akmenos ein L\u00e4cheln
        hervorzubringen und kletterte langsam die Hauswand<br \/>hinunter. Pelaios
        wollte ihm wirklich gleich folgen, doch als er sich umdrehte, um seinem Bruder
        zu<br \/>folgen, schweifte sein Blick unwillk\u00fcrlich \u00fcber das Bild
        des Grauens. Das Leben hier war nicht<br \/>immer einfach und sch\u00f6n,
        aber es war seine Heimat und die hatte man ihm genommen. Schweigend<br \/>verlie\u00df
        er das Dach und kam neben Akmenos mit gesenktem Blick zum Stehen. Der Gr\u00f6\u00dfere
        griff<br \/>seine Hand und zog ihn durch die Stra\u00dfen, die hinter dem
        Marktplatz lagen. Auch hier konnte man<br \/>die Verw\u00fcstung sehen, aber
        nur halb so schlimm, wie im Zentrum. Er nahm seinen Bruder mit zum<br \/>\u00e4u\u00dfersten
        Rand, weit weg von allem. Es gab dort ein sehr altes Haus, dessen Dach kaum
        mehr<br \/>vorhanden war, in dem auch seit Ewigkeiten niemand mehr gewohnt
        hatte. Hier hatten die Jungen<br \/>immer R\u00e4uber gespielt.<br \/>\u201eBleib
        hier. Ich zieh los und suche etwas zu essen.\u201c, sagte Akmenos, als es
        schlie\u00dflich anfing<br \/>dunkel zu werden. Doch gerade als er gehen wollte,
        griff Pelaios nach seinem Arm. \u201eGeh nicht weg,<br \/>bitte!\u201c, flehte
        er und nun standen ihm zum ersten Mal Tr\u00e4nen in den Augen. Der \u00c4ltere
        seufzte und<br \/>ging vor ihm in die Hocke. \u201eH\u00f6r zu. Stell dir
        einfach vor, dass du unsere Diebesh\u00f6hle besch\u00fctzen<br \/>musst,
        w\u00e4hrend ich losziehe und neues Diebesgut hole. In Ordnung?\u201c Aufmunternd
        l\u00e4chelte er ihn<br \/>an und setzte dann sein ernstes R\u00e4ubergesicht
        auf. \u201eDion, pass gut auf unsere H\u00f6hle auf!\u201c Und dann<br \/>verschwand
        er. Immer wenn sie spielten, benutzten sie nie ihre richtigen Namen, sondern
        nannten<br \/>sich Dion und Kairon. Der rothaarige Junge bem\u00fchte sich
        sehr stark zu sein und so zu tun, als<br \/>w\u00fcrden sie spielen, aber
        es wurde kalt und dunkel und Akmenos \u2013 Nein, Kairon \u2013 war noch immer<br
        \/>nicht zur\u00fcck. Er hatte Angst und weinte.<br \/>Er schreckte auf, als
        er sp\u00fcrte, wie jemand eine Decke auf ihn legte. \u201eSchlaf weiter...\u201c,
        fl\u00fcsterte<br \/>Akmenos, der inzwischen wieder zur\u00fcck war. Doch
        Pelaios sch\u00fcttelte den Kopf und rutschte zu<br \/>seinem Bruder, wo er
        sich anlehnte. \u201eHier, das habe ich gefunden.\u201c, sagte er sanft und
        hielt ihm einen<br \/>Ohrring hin, der seiner Mutter geh\u00f6rt hatte. Er
        griff nach ihm und betrachtete den roten Stein daran.<br \/>\u201eIch hab
        den anderen. Siehst du?\u201c Er zeigte ihm seinen und stach ihn sich durch
        das Ohrl\u00e4ppchen.<br \/>\u201eJetzt haben wir beide etwas, das uns verbindet
        und auch mit Mutter.\u201c Pelaios begriff, was das hie\u00df.<br \/>Sie waren
        nun alleine und auf sich gestellt.<br \/>Die beiden Jungen blieben im Teufelsdorf
        in ihrer Ruine ganz am \u00e4u\u00dfersten Stadtrand, wo niemals<br \/>jemand
        vorbeikam.<br \/>- 3 -<br \/>Sie bauten sich dort ein eigenes kleines Zuhause
        auf mit den Dingen, die sie auf der Stra\u00dfe fanden<br \/>oder aus der
        Stadt stahlen. Das Dorf war nicht mehr bewohnt und dem Erdboden beinahe gleich<br
        \/>gemacht. Es standen nur noch Ruinen dort, alles andere wurde niedergebrannt.
        Ob sich noch andere<br \/>\u00fcberlebende Tieflinge hier verschanzten, wussten
        die Jungen nicht genau, aber sie vermuteten es.<br \/>Denn ab und zu, wenn
        sie durch die Stra\u00dfen schlichen, mit Kapuzenumh\u00e4ngen getarnt, vernahmen<br
        \/>sie hie und da Schatten in den alten H\u00e4usern.<br \/>Um sich ein \u00dcberleben
        zu sichern mussten sie lernen sich selbst zu versorgen und Akmenos fing an<br
        \/>sich in der Stadt zu nehmen, was er brauchte. Nur selten nahm er seinen
        Bruder mit. Er wollte ihn<br \/>besch\u00fctzen und vor \u00c4rger fernhalten.
        Zwei Jahre lebten sie so. Es war nicht einfach, aber sie hatten<br \/>genug,
        um nicht zu verhungern oder zu erfrieren.<br \/>In der Stadt hatte sich Akmenos
        mit seinen siebzehn Jahren bereits einen Namen als Dieb<br \/>gemacht. Sie
        nannten ihn den ''schwarzen Blitz''. Er war schnell und geschickt und hatte
        irgendwann<br \/>leider das Aufsehen der Obrigkeit auf sich gelenkt. Eines
        Tages erlaubte er Pelaios mitzukommen in<br \/>die Stadt und Schmiere zu stehen.
        Mit seiner Steinschleuder gewappnet ging der kleine Tiefling, der<br \/>seine
        Kapuze tief \u00fcber das Gesicht gezogen hatte, auf das Dach, um dort zu
        lauern und seinem<br \/>Bruder im Notfall zur Seite stehen zu k\u00f6nnen.
        Er wollte gerade schie\u00dfen, als ein Mann mit dem<br \/>Wappen des F\u00fcrsten
        am Umhang seinen Bruder am Arm festhielt und ihn in eine Seitenstra\u00dfe
        zog.<br \/>Doch als der Kleinere bemerkte, dass es nicht zu Streitigkeiten
        kam, sondern die beiden miteinander<br \/>sprachen, lie\u00df Pelaios die
        Steinschleuder sinken und beobachtete stattdessen das Geschehen. Es war<br
        \/>seltsam und er konnte sich auch keinen Reim daraus machen.<br \/>Als er
        Akmenos darauf ansprach, wich er ihm aus und gab ihm keine richtige Antwort
        \u00fcber<br \/>was der Mann mit ihm gesprochen hat. Meistens sagte er nur:
        \u201eWir k\u00f6nnen froh sein, dass er mich<br \/>nicht festnehmen lassen
        hat.\u201c Irgendetwas war seltsam an der Sache und Pelaios konnte nicht<br
        \/>aufh\u00f6ren dar\u00fcber nachzudenken.<br \/>An einem Abend packte der
        \u00c4ltere, mit dem kupferfarbenen Haar, einen gro\u00dfen Beutel auf<br
        \/>den R\u00fccken und machte sich aufbruchbereit. \u201eWozu das ganze Zeug?\u201c,
        fragte Pelaios verwundert,<br \/>der gerade ein St\u00fcck Brot a\u00df. \u201eIch
        habe heute etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferes vor. Bleib du hier.\u201c, antwortete
        er.<br \/>Pelaios nickte und lie\u00df ihn ziehen. Seit er ihn in der Stadt
        mit dem Mann von dem F\u00fcrsten sprechen<br \/>sehen hat, sprach Akmenos
        kaum noch \u00fcber seine Pl\u00e4ne. Schnell schlang er sein letztes St\u00fcck
        Brot<br \/>herunter und wartete noch einen Moment, ehe er seinem Bruder folgte.<br
        \/>- 4 -<br \/>Als er ihn aufgesp\u00fcrt hatte, sah er ihn zwischen zwei
        Wachen stehen und vor ihm der Mann<br \/>mit dem Wappen des F\u00fcrsten,
        mit dem er zuvor schon einmal gesprochen hatten. In Begleitung der<br \/>bewaffneten
        M\u00e4nner gingen sie in ein nobel aussehendes Haus. Mit leisen Schritten
        folgte ihnen<br \/>Pelaios. Durch ein Fenster konnte er ein B\u00fcro sehen,
        in dem die M\u00e4nner an einem Tisch standen.<br \/>Doch der junge Tiefling
        konnte nichts h\u00f6ren. Gl\u00fccklicherweise hatte ihm sein Bruder gezeigt,
        wie<br \/>man Fenster \u00f6ffnet und er machte sich an dem Fenster des Nebenzimmers
        zu schaffen. Als er es<br \/>tats\u00e4chlich \u00f6ffnen konnte, trat er
        hinein und schlich sich an das B\u00fcro heran, um an der T\u00fcre zu<br
        \/>lauschen. \u201eIch schw\u00f6re mit meinem Leben, dass ich dem F\u00fcrst
        treu ergeben sein werde. Ich schw\u00f6re,<br \/>dass ich f\u00fcr ihn auskundschaften
        und morden werde. Hiermit lege ich meinen Eid ab und sollte ich<br \/>ihn
        jemals brechen, soll mein Kopf zu seinen F\u00fc\u00dfen liegen.\u201c Pelaios
        Augen weiteten sich, als ihm klar<br \/>wurde, dass das die Stimme seines
        Bruders war, die dort sprach. Ohne nachzudenken riss er die T\u00fcre<br \/>auf.
        \u201eWas tust du denn da?!\u201c Alle anwesenden drehten sich zu dem Eindringling
        um und starrten ihn<br \/>an. \u201eWer ist das?\u201c, fragte der Mann irritiert
        und befahl er seinen Wachen: \u201eT\u00f6tet ihn!\u201c Erschrocken<br \/>riss
        er die Augen auf, als die beiden Wachen mit erhobenen Schwerten auf ihn zukamen.<br
        \/>\u201eAkmenos!\u201c, schrie der junge Tiefling. Doch sein Bruder wendete
        das Gesicht von ihm ab und sagte<br \/>leise: \u201eEs w\u00e4re besser, wenn
        du fliehst.\u201c Pelaios konnte es nicht fassen und streckte die Hand nach<br
        \/>seinem Bruder aus. \u201eAber...\u201c Er konnte nicht weiter sprechen.
        \u201eVerschwinde!\u201c, br\u00fcllte Akmenos ihn<br \/>an und das tat er.
        Er drehte sich um und rannte so schnell er konnte fort.<br \/>Sein Bruder
        tauchte nie wieder bei ihm auf. Anfangs hatte er noch die Hoffnung, dass er
        sich<br \/>das nur eingebildet hatte, aber die Tage gingen dahin und von Akmenos
        gab es kein Zeichen des<br \/>Zur\u00fcckkommens. Er weinte und wusste nicht,
        was er tun sollte. In seiner Verzweiflung \u00fcber sein<br \/>Ungl\u00fcck,
        seine Herkunft und wie die Leute die Tieflinge behandelten, s\u00e4gte er
        sich seine H\u00f6rner so<br \/>weit ab, wie er nur konnte. Es tat weh, aber
        es ihm das Gef\u00fchl, ein bisschen mehr, wie die Menschen<br \/>zu sein.
        Doch als die Realit\u00e4t \u00fcber ihn hereinbrach und ihm bewusst wurde,
        dass sein gro\u00dfer Bruder<br \/>ihn im Stich gelassen hatte und es nicht
        die Schuld seiner Herkunft war, sondern die der Obrigkeit,<br \/>packte ihn
        die Wut. Innerlich brannte er, wie Feuer und \u00fcber Monate hinweg breitete
        sich das<br \/>Inferno in seinem Inneren immer mehr aus. Pelaios fasste einen
        Entschluss: Er w\u00fcrde die Stadt<br \/>verlassen, einen anderen Namen annehmen
        und das Handwerk eines Assasinen erlernen. Wenn er<br \/>soweit sein w\u00fcrde,
        w\u00fcrde er ihn, seinen Bruder, finden und dann w\u00fcrde er mit ihm abrechnen.<br
        \/><br \/>Die Obrigkeit hatte ihm alles genommen, seine Heimat, seine Eltern
        und seinen Bruder. Sie<br \/>haben ihm sein Leben genommen. Er wurde kalt
        im Herzen und wurde zu dem, zu was ihn alle<br \/>machten: Ein D\u00e4mon.<br
        \/>Er lieferte ''Obscuritas'', einer Gruppe von Assassinen, den Beweis, dass
        er w\u00fcrdig sei, bei<br \/>ihnen zu lernen. Und mit seinen dreizehn Jahren
        nahmen sie ihn auf und brachten ihm alles bei, was<br \/>er zu wissen brauchte
        f\u00fcr die dunkle Kunst des T\u00f6tens. Seinen ersten Auftrag durfte er
        bereits nach<br \/>drei Jahren erledigen und er stellte sich gut an. Das war
        seine Zukunft. Doch er war noch lange nicht<br \/>soweit. Dion \u2013 so nannte
        er sich nun \u2013 w\u00fcrde seine Kunst perfektionieren m\u00fcssen, um
        sich an jenen<br \/>zu r\u00e4chen, die ihm alles nahmen.<\/p>\n","entry_parsed":"\n<p>Vor
        einigen Jahren trug sich in den heruntergekommenen Randbezirken von ______________
        ein<br \/>tragisches Ereignis zu, das Dion niemals vergessen w\u00fcrde.<br
        \/>\u201eBeeil dich, Pelaios, sonst sind die besten Pl\u00e4tze weg!\u201c,
        rief ein junger Tiefling seinem kleinen Bruder<br \/>zu. Schnell versuchte
        der J\u00fcngere Akmenos aufzuholen. Doch als er merkte, dass dies kein Leichtes<br
        \/>war, beschloss er eine Abk\u00fcrzung zu nehmen und verschwand in einer
        dunklen Seitengasse, wo er<br \/>\u00fcber M\u00fcll und tote Ratten h\u00fcpfen
        musste. Sein vor Aufregung wedelnder Schweif schlug immer<br \/>wieder gegen
        die Hausw\u00e4nde in dem engen Durchgang. Er war erst acht Jahre alt und
        hatte das Ding,<br \/>das er hinter sich her schleifte noch nicht so unter
        Kontrolle, wie Akmenos, der fast doppelt so alt<br \/>war, wie er. Pelaios
        konnte das helle Licht am anderen Ende schon sehen und als er auf die Stra\u00dfe<br
        \/>stolperte, rannte er direkt in eine gro\u00dfe Traube von Leuten, die sich
        hier versammelt hatte. \u201eAuch<br \/>schon da?\u201c, ert\u00f6nte es hinter
        dem kleinen Tiefling mit einem Hauch von \u00dcberheblichkeit. \u201eIch warte<br
        \/>hier schon seit Ewigkeiten.\u201c, sagte Akmenos und entbl\u00f6\u00dfte
        seinen scharfen Z\u00e4hne, als er so tat, als<br \/>w\u00fcrde er g\u00e4hnen.
        Die goldenen Augen des Kleineren stierten w\u00fctend in die Roten des anderen.
        \u201eTu<br \/>nicht so, als w\u00e4rst du schon seit Stunden hier.\u201c,
        sagte er beleidigt und verschr\u00e4nkte die Arme.<br \/>Akmenos grinste nur
        und wuschelte ihm durch das blutrote Haar. \u201e Na komm.\u201c Er lotste
        ihn in eine<br \/>Seitenstra\u00dfe, die genau so verwahrlost war, wie alles
        im Teufelsdorf.<br \/>So nannten die Menschen den Randbezirk, in den die Obrigkeit
        die anwohnenden Tieflinge<br \/>vor vielen Jahren versto\u00dfen hatte. Es
        war ein Ort voller Armut, Krankheit und einer hohen<br \/>Kriminalit\u00e4tsrate.
        Viele nahmen \u00fcber die Zeit die Verhaltensweisen an, die ihnen zugeschrieben<br
        \/>wurden. Warum sich sittlich verhalten, wenn man ohnehin in jedermanns Auge
        ein Monster war?<br \/>Die beiden Jungen kletterten an den grob aufeinander
        gesetzten Steine eines alten und eher<br \/>ruinenhaft aussehenden Hauses
        hoch. Akmenos reichte seinem Bruder die Hand und zog ihn auf das<br \/>Dach.
        Dort oben hatten sie die perfekt Sicht auf das, was sich auf der Stra\u00dfe
        unter ihnen abspielte.<br \/>Heute war ein besonderer Tag und alle Tieflinge
        aus dem Teufelsdorf versammelten sich, um der<br \/>Verlesung der versprochenen
        Besserungen f\u00fcr den Randbezirk zu lauschen. Der F\u00fcrst hatte ihnen<br
        \/>versprochen, dass mehr in den Hausbau und in die medizinische Versorgung
        investiert werden soll.<br \/>Auch sollen sie mehr Abgaben der Ernte erhalten
        und wie jeder in der Stadt normal arbeiten d\u00fcrfen.<br \/>- 1 -<br \/>F\u00fcr
        die Erf\u00fcllung dieser Forderungen haben viele Tieflinge gek\u00e4mpft,
        aber nie wurde etwas<br \/>unternommen. Doch heute sollte es soweit sein.<br
        \/>Von hier oben hatten die beiden Jungen den perfekten Ausblick auf den Marktplatz.
        Es ert\u00f6nte ein<br \/>Horn und alle K\u00f6pfe wandten sich in die Richtung,
        von wo der Klang herkam. Auf hohen R\u00f6ssern<br \/>mit sch\u00f6nen Decken,
        auf denen das Emblem des F\u00fcrsten in goldenen Lettern aufgestickt war,
        ritt die<br \/>Stadtwache, gefolgt von einer Kutsche und einem weiteren dutzend
        Wachen auf den gro\u00dfen Platz.<br \/>Ein stattlicher Soldat mit einer goldenen
        R\u00fcstung, nahm seinen Helm ab und zog eine<br \/>Pergamentrolle aus seinem
        G\u00fcrtel. \u201eSeid gegr\u00fc\u00dft! Heute ist der Tag aller Tage. Nach
        vielen Stunden<br \/>der Beratung und Verhandlung, kam der F\u00fcrst nun
        endlich zu einem Entschluss. Es sollen endlich<br \/>Taten folgen und Ver\u00e4nderungen
        in kraft treten.\u201c Er rollt das Papier zusammen und steckt es wieder<br
        \/>weg. Er hebt langsam die Hand, w\u00e4hrend alle anwesenden gespannt auf
        die Kutsche blicken und auf<br \/>das Heraustreten des Beraters warten. \u201eAngriff!\u201c,
        ruft der Soldat.<br \/>Von allen Seiten str\u00f6men Soldaten in die Stra\u00dfen
        und Gassen. Mit schwingenden Schwertern<br \/>und Lanzen stechen sie auf die
        nichts ahnenden Tieflinge ein, die mit der Hoffnung auf Besserung<br \/>hergekommen
        waren. Es ist ein riesiges Massaker. Alles wehren hilft nichts. Die Ver\u00e4nderungen,
        die<br \/>dem F\u00fcrsten vorschweben ist die Eliminierung und Ausrottung
        des Teufelsdorfs. Egal ob Mann oder<br \/>Frau, jung oder alt, alles was den
        Soldaten in ihre rot gesprenkelten Klinge l\u00e4uft, wird ausradiert.<br
        \/>Die beiden Jungen auf dem Dach m\u00fcssen fassungslos dem Szenario, das
        sich auf den rot<br \/>gef\u00e4rbten Stra\u00dfen abspielt, zusehen. Pelaios
        kann das nicht verstehen, in ihm breitet sich Leere aus,<br \/>er f\u00fchlt
        gar nichts. Es scheint alles so unwirklich, dass es nur ein Alptraum sein
        kann. Doch als<br \/>Akmenos ihn an seine Brust zieht und fest an sich dr\u00fcckt,
        dass ihm dieses Bild voll Grauen erspart<br \/>bleibt, wird ihm klar, dass
        es sich hierbei um die Realit\u00e4t handelt. Der F\u00fcrst hatte sich die
        Hoffnung<br \/>der Tieflinge zu nutzen gemacht, um diese schlie\u00dflich
        in ihrem Blut zu ertr\u00e4nken. Das Einzige, das<br \/>Pelaios wahrnahm waren
        die Schreie und der bei\u00dfende Gestank von Blut, der sich irgendwann mit<br
        \/>Rauch vermischte. Er wollte schreien und weinen, aber er konnte nicht...<br
        \/>Irgendwann wurde es still und die schweren Schritte der Soldaten verrieten,
        dass sie ihren<br \/>Auftrag erf\u00fcllt hatten und abzogen. Pelaios sp\u00fcrte
        die warme Hand seines Bruders auf seinem Kopf,<br \/>wie sie beruhigend durch
        seine Haare streichelte. \u201eWir m\u00fcssen uns ein sicheres Versteck suchen.\u201c,<br
        \/>fl\u00fcsterte er ihm ins Ohr. \u201eVersuch nur mich anzusehen, h\u00f6rst
        du?\u201c Der Kleinere nickte kaum<br \/>merklich und l\u00f6ste sich aus
        seinen Armen.<br \/>- 2 -<br \/>Schwach versuchte Akmenos ein L\u00e4cheln
        hervorzubringen und kletterte langsam die Hauswand<br \/>hinunter. Pelaios
        wollte ihm wirklich gleich folgen, doch als er sich umdrehte, um seinem Bruder
        zu<br \/>folgen, schweifte sein Blick unwillk\u00fcrlich \u00fcber das Bild
        des Grauens. Das Leben hier war nicht<br \/>immer einfach und sch\u00f6n,
        aber es war seine Heimat und die hatte man ihm genommen. Schweigend<br \/>verlie\u00df
        er das Dach und kam neben Akmenos mit gesenktem Blick zum Stehen. Der Gr\u00f6\u00dfere
        griff<br \/>seine Hand und zog ihn durch die Stra\u00dfen, die hinter dem
        Marktplatz lagen. Auch hier konnte man<br \/>die Verw\u00fcstung sehen, aber
        nur halb so schlimm, wie im Zentrum. Er nahm seinen Bruder mit zum<br \/>\u00e4u\u00dfersten
        Rand, weit weg von allem. Es gab dort ein sehr altes Haus, dessen Dach kaum
        mehr<br \/>vorhanden war, in dem auch seit Ewigkeiten niemand mehr gewohnt
        hatte. Hier hatten die Jungen<br \/>immer R\u00e4uber gespielt.<br \/>\u201eBleib
        hier. Ich zieh los und suche etwas zu essen.\u201c, sagte Akmenos, als es
        schlie\u00dflich anfing<br \/>dunkel zu werden. Doch gerade als er gehen wollte,
        griff Pelaios nach seinem Arm. \u201eGeh nicht weg,<br \/>bitte!\u201c, flehte
        er und nun standen ihm zum ersten Mal Tr\u00e4nen in den Augen. Der \u00c4ltere
        seufzte und<br \/>ging vor ihm in die Hocke. \u201eH\u00f6r zu. Stell dir
        einfach vor, dass du unsere Diebesh\u00f6hle besch\u00fctzen<br \/>musst,
        w\u00e4hrend ich losziehe und neues Diebesgut hole. In Ordnung?\u201c Aufmunternd
        l\u00e4chelte er ihn<br \/>an und setzte dann sein ernstes R\u00e4ubergesicht
        auf. \u201eDion, pass gut auf unsere H\u00f6hle auf!\u201c Und dann<br \/>verschwand
        er. Immer wenn sie spielten, benutzten sie nie ihre richtigen Namen, sondern
        nannten<br \/>sich Dion und Kairon. Der rothaarige Junge bem\u00fchte sich
        sehr stark zu sein und so zu tun, als<br \/>w\u00fcrden sie spielen, aber
        es wurde kalt und dunkel und Akmenos \u2013 Nein, Kairon \u2013 war noch immer<br
        \/>nicht zur\u00fcck. Er hatte Angst und weinte.<br \/>Er schreckte auf, als
        er sp\u00fcrte, wie jemand eine Decke auf ihn legte. \u201eSchlaf weiter...\u201c,
        fl\u00fcsterte<br \/>Akmenos, der inzwischen wieder zur\u00fcck war. Doch
        Pelaios sch\u00fcttelte den Kopf und rutschte zu<br \/>seinem Bruder, wo er
        sich anlehnte. \u201eHier, das habe ich gefunden.\u201c, sagte er sanft und
        hielt ihm einen<br \/>Ohrring hin, der seiner Mutter geh\u00f6rt hatte. Er
        griff nach ihm und betrachtete den roten Stein daran.<br \/>\u201eIch hab
        den anderen. Siehst du?\u201c Er zeigte ihm seinen und stach ihn sich durch
        das Ohrl\u00e4ppchen.<br \/>\u201eJetzt haben wir beide etwas, das uns verbindet
        und auch mit Mutter.\u201c Pelaios begriff, was das hie\u00df.<br \/>Sie waren
        nun alleine und auf sich gestellt.<br \/>Die beiden Jungen blieben im Teufelsdorf
        in ihrer Ruine ganz am \u00e4u\u00dfersten Stadtrand, wo niemals<br \/>jemand
        vorbeikam.<br \/>- 3 -<br \/>Sie bauten sich dort ein eigenes kleines Zuhause
        auf mit den Dingen, die sie auf der Stra\u00dfe fanden<br \/>oder aus der
        Stadt stahlen. Das Dorf war nicht mehr bewohnt und dem Erdboden beinahe gleich<br
        \/>gemacht. Es standen nur noch Ruinen dort, alles andere wurde niedergebrannt.
        Ob sich noch andere<br \/>\u00fcberlebende Tieflinge hier verschanzten, wussten
        die Jungen nicht genau, aber sie vermuteten es.<br \/>Denn ab und zu, wenn
        sie durch die Stra\u00dfen schlichen, mit Kapuzenumh\u00e4ngen getarnt, vernahmen<br
        \/>sie hie und da Schatten in den alten H\u00e4usern.<br \/>Um sich ein \u00dcberleben
        zu sichern mussten sie lernen sich selbst zu versorgen und Akmenos fing an<br
        \/>sich in der Stadt zu nehmen, was er brauchte. Nur selten nahm er seinen
        Bruder mit. Er wollte ihn<br \/>besch\u00fctzen und vor \u00c4rger fernhalten.
        Zwei Jahre lebten sie so. Es war nicht einfach, aber sie hatten<br \/>genug,
        um nicht zu verhungern oder zu erfrieren.<br \/>In der Stadt hatte sich Akmenos
        mit seinen siebzehn Jahren bereits einen Namen als Dieb<br \/>gemacht. Sie
        nannten ihn den ''schwarzen Blitz''. Er war schnell und geschickt und hatte
        irgendwann<br \/>leider das Aufsehen der Obrigkeit auf sich gelenkt. Eines
        Tages erlaubte er Pelaios mitzukommen in<br \/>die Stadt und Schmiere zu stehen.
        Mit seiner Steinschleuder gewappnet ging der kleine Tiefling, der<br \/>seine
        Kapuze tief \u00fcber das Gesicht gezogen hatte, auf das Dach, um dort zu
        lauern und seinem<br \/>Bruder im Notfall zur Seite stehen zu k\u00f6nnen.
        Er wollte gerade schie\u00dfen, als ein Mann mit dem<br \/>Wappen des F\u00fcrsten
        am Umhang seinen Bruder am Arm festhielt und ihn in eine Seitenstra\u00dfe
        zog.<br \/>Doch als der Kleinere bemerkte, dass es nicht zu Streitigkeiten
        kam, sondern die beiden miteinander<br \/>sprachen, lie\u00df Pelaios die
        Steinschleuder sinken und beobachtete stattdessen das Geschehen. Es war<br
        \/>seltsam und er konnte sich auch keinen Reim daraus machen.<br \/>Als er
        Akmenos darauf ansprach, wich er ihm aus und gab ihm keine richtige Antwort
        \u00fcber<br \/>was der Mann mit ihm gesprochen hat. Meistens sagte er nur:
        \u201eWir k\u00f6nnen froh sein, dass er mich<br \/>nicht festnehmen lassen
        hat.\u201c Irgendetwas war seltsam an der Sache und Pelaios konnte nicht<br
        \/>aufh\u00f6ren dar\u00fcber nachzudenken.<br \/>An einem Abend packte der
        \u00c4ltere, mit dem kupferfarbenen Haar, einen gro\u00dfen Beutel auf<br
        \/>den R\u00fccken und machte sich aufbruchbereit. \u201eWozu das ganze Zeug?\u201c,
        fragte Pelaios verwundert,<br \/>der gerade ein St\u00fcck Brot a\u00df. \u201eIch
        habe heute etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferes vor. Bleib du hier.\u201c, antwortete
        er.<br \/>Pelaios nickte und lie\u00df ihn ziehen. Seit er ihn in der Stadt
        mit dem Mann von dem F\u00fcrsten sprechen<br \/>sehen hat, sprach Akmenos
        kaum noch \u00fcber seine Pl\u00e4ne. Schnell schlang er sein letztes St\u00fcck
        Brot<br \/>herunter und wartete noch einen Moment, ehe er seinem Bruder folgte.<br
        \/>- 4 -<br \/>Als er ihn aufgesp\u00fcrt hatte, sah er ihn zwischen zwei
        Wachen stehen und vor ihm der Mann<br \/>mit dem Wappen des F\u00fcrsten,
        mit dem er zuvor schon einmal gesprochen hatten. In Begleitung der<br \/>bewaffneten
        M\u00e4nner gingen sie in ein nobel aussehendes Haus. Mit leisen Schritten
        folgte ihnen<br \/>Pelaios. Durch ein Fenster konnte er ein B\u00fcro sehen,
        in dem die M\u00e4nner an einem Tisch standen.<br \/>Doch der junge Tiefling
        konnte nichts h\u00f6ren. Gl\u00fccklicherweise hatte ihm sein Bruder gezeigt,
        wie<br \/>man Fenster \u00f6ffnet und er machte sich an dem Fenster des Nebenzimmers
        zu schaffen. Als er es<br \/>tats\u00e4chlich \u00f6ffnen konnte, trat er
        hinein und schlich sich an das B\u00fcro heran, um an der T\u00fcre zu<br
        \/>lauschen. \u201eIch schw\u00f6re mit meinem Leben, dass ich dem F\u00fcrst
        treu ergeben sein werde. Ich schw\u00f6re,<br \/>dass ich f\u00fcr ihn auskundschaften
        und morden werde. Hiermit lege ich meinen Eid ab und sollte ich<br \/>ihn
        jemals brechen, soll mein Kopf zu seinen F\u00fc\u00dfen liegen.\u201c Pelaios
        Augen weiteten sich, als ihm klar<br \/>wurde, dass das die Stimme seines
        Bruders war, die dort sprach. Ohne nachzudenken riss er die T\u00fcre<br \/>auf.
        \u201eWas tust du denn da?!\u201c Alle anwesenden drehten sich zu dem Eindringling
        um und starrten ihn<br \/>an. \u201eWer ist das?\u201c, fragte der Mann irritiert
        und befahl er seinen Wachen: \u201eT\u00f6tet ihn!\u201c Erschrocken<br \/>riss
        er die Augen auf, als die beiden Wachen mit erhobenen Schwerten auf ihn zukamen.<br
        \/>\u201eAkmenos!\u201c, schrie der junge Tiefling. Doch sein Bruder wendete
        das Gesicht von ihm ab und sagte<br \/>leise: \u201eEs w\u00e4re besser, wenn
        du fliehst.\u201c Pelaios konnte es nicht fassen und streckte die Hand nach<br
        \/>seinem Bruder aus. \u201eAber...\u201c Er konnte nicht weiter sprechen.
        \u201eVerschwinde!\u201c, br\u00fcllte Akmenos ihn<br \/>an und das tat er.
        Er drehte sich um und rannte so schnell er konnte fort.<br \/>Sein Bruder
        tauchte nie wieder bei ihm auf. Anfangs hatte er noch die Hoffnung, dass er
        sich<br \/>das nur eingebildet hatte, aber die Tage gingen dahin und von Akmenos
        gab es kein Zeichen des<br \/>Zur\u00fcckkommens. Er weinte und wusste nicht,
        was er tun sollte. In seiner Verzweiflung \u00fcber sein<br \/>Ungl\u00fcck,
        seine Herkunft und wie die Leute die Tieflinge behandelten, s\u00e4gte er
        sich seine H\u00f6rner so<br \/>weit ab, wie er nur konnte. Es tat weh, aber
        es ihm das Gef\u00fchl, ein bisschen mehr, wie die Menschen<br \/>zu sein.
        Doch als die Realit\u00e4t \u00fcber ihn hereinbrach und ihm bewusst wurde,
        dass sein gro\u00dfer Bruder<br \/>ihn im Stich gelassen hatte und es nicht
        die Schuld seiner Herkunft war, sondern die der Obrigkeit,<br \/>packte ihn
        die Wut. Innerlich brannte er, wie Feuer und \u00fcber Monate hinweg breitete
        sich das<br \/>Inferno in seinem Inneren immer mehr aus. Pelaios fasste einen
        Entschluss: Er w\u00fcrde die Stadt<br \/>verlassen, einen anderen Namen annehmen
        und das Handwerk eines Assasinen erlernen. Wenn er<br \/>soweit sein w\u00fcrde,
        w\u00fcrde er ihn, seinen Bruder, finden und dann w\u00fcrde er mit ihm abrechnen.<br
        \/><br \/>Die Obrigkeit hatte ihm alles genommen, seine Heimat, seine Eltern
        und seinen Bruder. Sie<br \/>haben ihm sein Leben genommen. Er wurde kalt
        im Herzen und wurde zu dem, zu was ihn alle<br \/>machten: Ein D\u00e4mon.<br
        \/>Er lieferte ''Obscuritas'', einer Gruppe von Assassinen, den Beweis, dass
        er w\u00fcrdig sei, bei<br \/>ihnen zu lernen. Und mit seinen dreizehn Jahren
        nahmen sie ihn auf und brachten ihm alles bei, was<br \/>er zu wissen brauchte
        f\u00fcr die dunkle Kunst des T\u00f6tens. Seinen ersten Auftrag durfte er
        bereits nach<br \/>drei Jahren erledigen und er stellte sich gut an. Das war
        seine Zukunft. Doch er war noch lange nicht<br \/>soweit. Dion \u2013 so nannte
        er sich nun \u2013 w\u00fcrde seine Kunst perfektionieren m\u00fcssen, um
        sich an jenen<br \/>zu r\u00e4chen, die ihm alles nahmen.<\/p>\n","image":"characters\/k1hNDK5wHJYQ3zUyDSneecolDv0DKwkgHKprPwpw.jpeg","focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"image_full":"https:\/\/images.kanka.io\/user\/hUn3ERL8LOIyT236SB-9EUizWU4=\/smart\/src\/characters%2Fk1hNDK5wHJYQ3zUyDSneecolDv0DKwkgHKprPwpw.jpeg?webpfallback","image_thumb":"https:\/\/images.kanka.io\/user\/1hxcbhH_bhYT7yaHvQ0Pp-Q_obU=\/40x40\/smart\/src\/characters%2Fk1hNDK5wHJYQ3zUyDSneecolDv0DKwkgHKprPwpw.jpeg?webpfallback","has_custom_image":true,"header_full":"","has_custom_header":false,"is_private":false,"is_template":false,"entity_id":12073,"tags":[24197,19193],"created_at":"2018-04-03T19:58:48.000000Z","created_by":null,"updated_at":"2019-08-09T10:35:32.000000Z","updated_by":1,"location_id":930,"title":"Spymaster

        its just a form of energy like everything else in the universe. So they dont
        hort money instad they give the energy to somebody else and get another form
        of energy back. They get money or food for singing, telling storys, helping
        sick people with ther wisdom about the nature.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>when
        the family visited Medina Dony gets a havy sunburn and has to stay in the

        is the tale that if a satire dies he incarnade as the energy he loves the

        like to stay in one place to long.<\/p>\n<p>Diony has the talent to play music
        with everything. even with a carrot. she belives that sometimes there a not

        every wonder in this world gives so much energy\u2026and she is able to give
        some of the energy back as a thanks and praise in form of music. that\u2019s

        her journey she got to know an orc named [character:1029781]. Diony thinks

        ein<br \/>tragisches Ereignis zu, das Dion niemals vergessen w\u00fcrde.<br
        \/>\u201eBeeil dich, Pelaios, sonst sind die besten Pl\u00e4tze weg!\u201c,
        rief ein junger Tiefling seinem kleinen Bruder<br \/>zu. Schnell versuchte
        der J\u00fcngere Akmenos aufzuholen. Doch als er merkte, dass dies kein Leichtes<br
        \/>war, beschloss er eine Abk\u00fcrzung zu nehmen und verschwand in einer
        dunklen Seitengasse, wo er<br \/>\u00fcber M\u00fcll und tote Ratten h\u00fcpfen
        musste. Sein vor Aufregung wedelnder Schweif schlug immer<br \/>wieder gegen
        die Hausw\u00e4nde in dem engen Durchgang. Er war erst acht Jahre alt und
        hatte das Ding,<br \/>das er hinter sich her schleifte noch nicht so unter
        Kontrolle, wie Akmenos, der fast doppelt so alt<br \/>war, wie er. Pelaios
        konnte das helle Licht am anderen Ende schon sehen und als er auf die Stra\u00dfe<br
        \/>stolperte, rannte er direkt in eine gro\u00dfe Traube von Leuten, die sich
        hier versammelt hatte. \u201eAuch<br \/>schon da?\u201c, ert\u00f6nte es hinter
        dem kleinen Tiefling mit einem Hauch von \u00dcberheblichkeit. \u201eIch warte<br
        \/>hier schon seit Ewigkeiten.\u201c, sagte Akmenos und entbl\u00f6\u00dfte
        seinen scharfen Z\u00e4hne, als er so tat, als<br \/>w\u00fcrde er g\u00e4hnen.
        Die goldenen Augen des Kleineren stierten w\u00fctend in die Roten des anderen.
        \u201eTu<br \/>nicht so, als w\u00e4rst du schon seit Stunden hier.\u201c,
        sagte er beleidigt und verschr\u00e4nkte die Arme.<br \/>Akmenos grinste nur
        und wuschelte ihm durch das blutrote Haar. \u201e Na komm.\u201c Er lotste
        ihn in eine<br \/>Seitenstra\u00dfe, die genau so verwahrlost war, wie alles
        im Teufelsdorf.<br \/>So nannten die Menschen den Randbezirk, in den die Obrigkeit
        die anwohnenden Tieflinge<br \/>vor vielen Jahren versto\u00dfen hatte. Es
        war ein Ort voller Armut, Krankheit und einer hohen<br \/>Kriminalit\u00e4tsrate.
        Viele nahmen \u00fcber die Zeit die Verhaltensweisen an, die ihnen zugeschrieben<br
        \/>wurden. Warum sich sittlich verhalten, wenn man ohnehin in jedermanns Auge
        ein Monster war?<br \/>Die beiden Jungen kletterten an den grob aufeinander
        gesetzten Steine eines alten und eher<br \/>ruinenhaft aussehenden Hauses
        hoch. Akmenos reichte seinem Bruder die Hand und zog ihn auf das<br \/>Dach.
        Dort oben hatten sie die perfekt Sicht auf das, was sich auf der Stra\u00dfe
        unter ihnen abspielte.<br \/>Heute war ein besonderer Tag und alle Tieflinge
        aus dem Teufelsdorf versammelten sich, um der<br \/>Verlesung der versprochenen
        Besserungen f\u00fcr den Randbezirk zu lauschen. Der F\u00fcrst hatte ihnen<br
        \/>versprochen, dass mehr in den Hausbau und in die medizinische Versorgung
        investiert werden soll.<br \/>Auch sollen sie mehr Abgaben der Ernte erhalten
        und wie jeder in der Stadt normal arbeiten d\u00fcrfen.<br \/>- 1 -<br \/>F\u00fcr
        die Erf\u00fcllung dieser Forderungen haben viele Tieflinge gek\u00e4mpft,
        aber nie wurde etwas<br \/>unternommen. Doch heute sollte es soweit sein.<br
        \/>Von hier oben hatten die beiden Jungen den perfekten Ausblick auf den Marktplatz.
        Es ert\u00f6nte ein<br \/>Horn und alle K\u00f6pfe wandten sich in die Richtung,
        von wo der Klang herkam. Auf hohen R\u00f6ssern<br \/>mit sch\u00f6nen Decken,
        auf denen das Emblem des F\u00fcrsten in goldenen Lettern aufgestickt war,
        ritt die<br \/>Stadtwache, gefolgt von einer Kutsche und einem weiteren dutzend
        Wachen auf den gro\u00dfen Platz.<br \/>Ein stattlicher Soldat mit einer goldenen
        R\u00fcstung, nahm seinen Helm ab und zog eine<br \/>Pergamentrolle aus seinem
        G\u00fcrtel. \u201eSeid gegr\u00fc\u00dft! Heute ist der Tag aller Tage. Nach
        vielen Stunden<br \/>der Beratung und Verhandlung, kam der F\u00fcrst nun
        endlich zu einem Entschluss. Es sollen endlich<br \/>Taten folgen und Ver\u00e4nderungen
        in kraft treten.\u201c Er rollt das Papier zusammen und steckt es wieder<br
        \/>weg. Er hebt langsam die Hand, w\u00e4hrend alle anwesenden gespannt auf
        die Kutsche blicken und auf<br \/>das Heraustreten des Beraters warten. \u201eAngriff!\u201c,
        ruft der Soldat.<br \/>Von allen Seiten str\u00f6men Soldaten in die Stra\u00dfen
        und Gassen. Mit schwingenden Schwertern<br \/>und Lanzen stechen sie auf die
        nichts ahnenden Tieflinge ein, die mit der Hoffnung auf Besserung<br \/>hergekommen
        waren. Es ist ein riesiges Massaker. Alles wehren hilft nichts. Die Ver\u00e4nderungen,
        die<br \/>dem F\u00fcrsten vorschweben ist die Eliminierung und Ausrottung
        des Teufelsdorfs. Egal ob Mann oder<br \/>Frau, jung oder alt, alles was den
        Soldaten in ihre rot gesprenkelten Klinge l\u00e4uft, wird ausradiert.<br
        \/>Die beiden Jungen auf dem Dach m\u00fcssen fassungslos dem Szenario, das
        sich auf den rot<br \/>gef\u00e4rbten Stra\u00dfen abspielt, zusehen. Pelaios
        kann das nicht verstehen, in ihm breitet sich Leere aus,<br \/>er f\u00fchlt
        gar nichts. Es scheint alles so unwirklich, dass es nur ein Alptraum sein
        kann. Doch als<br \/>Akmenos ihn an seine Brust zieht und fest an sich dr\u00fcckt,
        dass ihm dieses Bild voll Grauen erspart<br \/>bleibt, wird ihm klar, dass
        es sich hierbei um die Realit\u00e4t handelt. Der F\u00fcrst hatte sich die
        Hoffnung<br \/>der Tieflinge zu nutzen gemacht, um diese schlie\u00dflich
        in ihrem Blut zu ertr\u00e4nken. Das Einzige, das<br \/>Pelaios wahrnahm waren
        die Schreie und der bei\u00dfende Gestank von Blut, der sich irgendwann mit<br
        \/>Rauch vermischte. Er wollte schreien und weinen, aber er konnte nicht...<br
        \/>Irgendwann wurde es still und die schweren Schritte der Soldaten verrieten,
        dass sie ihren<br \/>Auftrag erf\u00fcllt hatten und abzogen. Pelaios sp\u00fcrte
        die warme Hand seines Bruders auf seinem Kopf,<br \/>wie sie beruhigend durch
        seine Haare streichelte. \u201eWir m\u00fcssen uns ein sicheres Versteck suchen.\u201c,<br
        \/>fl\u00fcsterte er ihm ins Ohr. \u201eVersuch nur mich anzusehen, h\u00f6rst
        du?\u201c Der Kleinere nickte kaum<br \/>merklich und l\u00f6ste sich aus
        seinen Armen.<br \/>- 2 -<br \/>Schwach versuchte Akmenos ein L\u00e4cheln
        hervorzubringen und kletterte langsam die Hauswand<br \/>hinunter. Pelaios
        wollte ihm wirklich gleich folgen, doch als er sich umdrehte, um seinem Bruder
        zu<br \/>folgen, schweifte sein Blick unwillk\u00fcrlich \u00fcber das Bild
        des Grauens. Das Leben hier war nicht<br \/>immer einfach und sch\u00f6n,
        aber es war seine Heimat und die hatte man ihm genommen. Schweigend<br \/>verlie\u00df
        er das Dach und kam neben Akmenos mit gesenktem Blick zum Stehen. Der Gr\u00f6\u00dfere
        griff<br \/>seine Hand und zog ihn durch die Stra\u00dfen, die hinter dem
        Marktplatz lagen. Auch hier konnte man<br \/>die Verw\u00fcstung sehen, aber
        nur halb so schlimm, wie im Zentrum. Er nahm seinen Bruder mit zum<br \/>\u00e4u\u00dfersten
        Rand, weit weg von allem. Es gab dort ein sehr altes Haus, dessen Dach kaum
        mehr<br \/>vorhanden war, in dem auch seit Ewigkeiten niemand mehr gewohnt
        hatte. Hier hatten die Jungen<br \/>immer R\u00e4uber gespielt.<br \/>\u201eBleib
        hier. Ich zieh los und suche etwas zu essen.\u201c, sagte Akmenos, als es
        schlie\u00dflich anfing<br \/>dunkel zu werden. Doch gerade als er gehen wollte,
        griff Pelaios nach seinem Arm. \u201eGeh nicht weg,<br \/>bitte!\u201c, flehte
        er und nun standen ihm zum ersten Mal Tr\u00e4nen in den Augen. Der \u00c4ltere
        seufzte und<br \/>ging vor ihm in die Hocke. \u201eH\u00f6r zu. Stell dir
        einfach vor, dass du unsere Diebesh\u00f6hle besch\u00fctzen<br \/>musst,
        w\u00e4hrend ich losziehe und neues Diebesgut hole. In Ordnung?\u201c Aufmunternd
        l\u00e4chelte er ihn<br \/>an und setzte dann sein ernstes R\u00e4ubergesicht
        auf. \u201eDion, pass gut auf unsere H\u00f6hle auf!\u201c Und dann<br \/>verschwand
        er. Immer wenn sie spielten, benutzten sie nie ihre richtigen Namen, sondern
        nannten<br \/>sich Dion und Kairon. Der rothaarige Junge bem\u00fchte sich
        sehr stark zu sein und so zu tun, als<br \/>w\u00fcrden sie spielen, aber
        es wurde kalt und dunkel und Akmenos \u2013 Nein, Kairon \u2013 war noch immer<br
        \/>nicht zur\u00fcck. Er hatte Angst und weinte.<br \/>Er schreckte auf, als
        er sp\u00fcrte, wie jemand eine Decke auf ihn legte. \u201eSchlaf weiter...\u201c,
        fl\u00fcsterte<br \/>Akmenos, der inzwischen wieder zur\u00fcck war. Doch
        Pelaios sch\u00fcttelte den Kopf und rutschte zu<br \/>seinem Bruder, wo er
        sich anlehnte. \u201eHier, das habe ich gefunden.\u201c, sagte er sanft und
        hielt ihm einen<br \/>Ohrring hin, der seiner Mutter geh\u00f6rt hatte. Er
        griff nach ihm und betrachtete den roten Stein daran.<br \/>\u201eIch hab
        den anderen. Siehst du?\u201c Er zeigte ihm seinen und stach ihn sich durch
        das Ohrl\u00e4ppchen.<br \/>\u201eJetzt haben wir beide etwas, das uns verbindet
        und auch mit Mutter.\u201c Pelaios begriff, was das hie\u00df.<br \/>Sie waren
        nun alleine und auf sich gestellt.<br \/>Die beiden Jungen blieben im Teufelsdorf
        in ihrer Ruine ganz am \u00e4u\u00dfersten Stadtrand, wo niemals<br \/>jemand
        vorbeikam.<br \/>- 3 -<br \/>Sie bauten sich dort ein eigenes kleines Zuhause
        auf mit den Dingen, die sie auf der Stra\u00dfe fanden<br \/>oder aus der
        Stadt stahlen. Das Dorf war nicht mehr bewohnt und dem Erdboden beinahe gleich<br
        \/>gemacht. Es standen nur noch Ruinen dort, alles andere wurde niedergebrannt.
        Ob sich noch andere<br \/>\u00fcberlebende Tieflinge hier verschanzten, wussten
        die Jungen nicht genau, aber sie vermuteten es.<br \/>Denn ab und zu, wenn
        sie durch die Stra\u00dfen schlichen, mit Kapuzenumh\u00e4ngen getarnt, vernahmen<br
        \/>sie hie und da Schatten in den alten H\u00e4usern.<br \/>Um sich ein \u00dcberleben
        zu sichern mussten sie lernen sich selbst zu versorgen und Akmenos fing an<br
        \/>sich in der Stadt zu nehmen, was er brauchte. Nur selten nahm er seinen
        Bruder mit. Er wollte ihn<br \/>besch\u00fctzen und vor \u00c4rger fernhalten.
        Zwei Jahre lebten sie so. Es war nicht einfach, aber sie hatten<br \/>genug,
        um nicht zu verhungern oder zu erfrieren.<br \/>In der Stadt hatte sich Akmenos
        mit seinen siebzehn Jahren bereits einen Namen als Dieb<br \/>gemacht. Sie
        nannten ihn den ''schwarzen Blitz''. Er war schnell und geschickt und hatte
        irgendwann<br \/>leider das Aufsehen der Obrigkeit auf sich gelenkt. Eines
        Tages erlaubte er Pelaios mitzukommen in<br \/>die Stadt und Schmiere zu stehen.
        Mit seiner Steinschleuder gewappnet ging der kleine Tiefling, der<br \/>seine
        Kapuze tief \u00fcber das Gesicht gezogen hatte, auf das Dach, um dort zu
        lauern und seinem<br \/>Bruder im Notfall zur Seite stehen zu k\u00f6nnen.
        Er wollte gerade schie\u00dfen, als ein Mann mit dem<br \/>Wappen des F\u00fcrsten
        am Umhang seinen Bruder am Arm festhielt und ihn in eine Seitenstra\u00dfe
        zog.<br \/>Doch als der Kleinere bemerkte, dass es nicht zu Streitigkeiten
        kam, sondern die beiden miteinander<br \/>sprachen, lie\u00df Pelaios die
        Steinschleuder sinken und beobachtete stattdessen das Geschehen. Es war<br
        \/>seltsam und er konnte sich auch keinen Reim daraus machen.<br \/>Als er
        Akmenos darauf ansprach, wich er ihm aus und gab ihm keine richtige Antwort
        \u00fcber<br \/>was der Mann mit ihm gesprochen hat. Meistens sagte er nur:
        \u201eWir k\u00f6nnen froh sein, dass er mich<br \/>nicht festnehmen lassen
        hat.\u201c Irgendetwas war seltsam an der Sache und Pelaios konnte nicht<br
        \/>aufh\u00f6ren dar\u00fcber nachzudenken.<br \/>An einem Abend packte der
        \u00c4ltere, mit dem kupferfarbenen Haar, einen gro\u00dfen Beutel auf<br
        \/>den R\u00fccken und machte sich aufbruchbereit. \u201eWozu das ganze Zeug?\u201c,
        fragte Pelaios verwundert,<br \/>der gerade ein St\u00fcck Brot a\u00df. \u201eIch
        habe heute etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferes vor. Bleib du hier.\u201c, antwortete
        er.<br \/>Pelaios nickte und lie\u00df ihn ziehen. Seit er ihn in der Stadt
        mit dem Mann von dem F\u00fcrsten sprechen<br \/>sehen hat, sprach Akmenos
        kaum noch \u00fcber seine Pl\u00e4ne. Schnell schlang er sein letztes St\u00fcck
        Brot<br \/>herunter und wartete noch einen Moment, ehe er seinem Bruder folgte.<br
        \/>- 4 -<br \/>Als er ihn aufgesp\u00fcrt hatte, sah er ihn zwischen zwei
        Wachen stehen und vor ihm der Mann<br \/>mit dem Wappen des F\u00fcrsten,
        mit dem er zuvor schon einmal gesprochen hatten. In Begleitung der<br \/>bewaffneten
        M\u00e4nner gingen sie in ein nobel aussehendes Haus. Mit leisen Schritten
        folgte ihnen<br \/>Pelaios. Durch ein Fenster konnte er ein B\u00fcro sehen,
        in dem die M\u00e4nner an einem Tisch standen.<br \/>Doch der junge Tiefling
        konnte nichts h\u00f6ren. Gl\u00fccklicherweise hatte ihm sein Bruder gezeigt,
        wie<br \/>man Fenster \u00f6ffnet und er machte sich an dem Fenster des Nebenzimmers
        zu schaffen. Als er es<br \/>tats\u00e4chlich \u00f6ffnen konnte, trat er
        hinein und schlich sich an das B\u00fcro heran, um an der T\u00fcre zu<br
        \/>lauschen. \u201eIch schw\u00f6re mit meinem Leben, dass ich dem F\u00fcrst
        treu ergeben sein werde. Ich schw\u00f6re,<br \/>dass ich f\u00fcr ihn auskundschaften
        und morden werde. Hiermit lege ich meinen Eid ab und sollte ich<br \/>ihn
        jemals brechen, soll mein Kopf zu seinen F\u00fc\u00dfen liegen.\u201c Pelaios
        Augen weiteten sich, als ihm klar<br \/>wurde, dass das die Stimme seines
        Bruders war, die dort sprach. Ohne nachzudenken riss er die T\u00fcre<br \/>auf.
        \u201eWas tust du denn da?!\u201c Alle anwesenden drehten sich zu dem Eindringling
        um und starrten ihn<br \/>an. \u201eWer ist das?\u201c, fragte der Mann irritiert
        und befahl er seinen Wachen: \u201eT\u00f6tet ihn!\u201c Erschrocken<br \/>riss
        er die Augen auf, als die beiden Wachen mit erhobenen Schwerten auf ihn zukamen.<br
        \/>\u201eAkmenos!\u201c, schrie der junge Tiefling. Doch sein Bruder wendete
        das Gesicht von ihm ab und sagte<br \/>leise: \u201eEs w\u00e4re besser, wenn
        du fliehst.\u201c Pelaios konnte es nicht fassen und streckte die Hand nach<br
        \/>seinem Bruder aus. \u201eAber...\u201c Er konnte nicht weiter sprechen.
        \u201eVerschwinde!\u201c, br\u00fcllte Akmenos ihn<br \/>an und das tat er.
        Er drehte sich um und rannte so schnell er konnte fort.<br \/>Sein Bruder
        tauchte nie wieder bei ihm auf. Anfangs hatte er noch die Hoffnung, dass er
        sich<br \/>das nur eingebildet hatte, aber die Tage gingen dahin und von Akmenos
        gab es kein Zeichen des<br \/>Zur\u00fcckkommens. Er weinte und wusste nicht,
        was er tun sollte. In seiner Verzweiflung \u00fcber sein<br \/>Ungl\u00fcck,
        seine Herkunft und wie die Leute die Tieflinge behandelten, s\u00e4gte er
        sich seine H\u00f6rner so<br \/>weit ab, wie er nur konnte. Es tat weh, aber
        es ihm das Gef\u00fchl, ein bisschen mehr, wie die Menschen<br \/>zu sein.
        Doch als die Realit\u00e4t \u00fcber ihn hereinbrach und ihm bewusst wurde,
        dass sein gro\u00dfer Bruder<br \/>ihn im Stich gelassen hatte und es nicht
        die Schuld seiner Herkunft war, sondern die der Obrigkeit,<br \/>packte ihn
        die Wut. Innerlich brannte er, wie Feuer und \u00fcber Monate hinweg breitete
        sich das<br \/>Inferno in seinem Inneren immer mehr aus. Pelaios fasste einen
        Entschluss: Er w\u00fcrde die Stadt<br \/>verlassen, einen anderen Namen annehmen
        und das Handwerk eines Assasinen erlernen. Wenn er<br \/>soweit sein w\u00fcrde,
        w\u00fcrde er ihn, seinen Bruder, finden und dann w\u00fcrde er mit ihm abrechnen.<br
        \/><br \/>Die Obrigkeit hatte ihm alles genommen, seine Heimat, seine Eltern
        und seinen Bruder. Sie<br \/>haben ihm sein Leben genommen. Er wurde kalt
        im Herzen und wurde zu dem, zu was ihn alle<br \/>machten: Ein D\u00e4mon.<br
        \/>Er lieferte ''Obscuritas'', einer Gruppe von Assassinen, den Beweis, dass
        er w\u00fcrdig sei, bei<br \/>ihnen zu lernen. Und mit seinen dreizehn Jahren
        nahmen sie ihn auf und brachten ihm alles bei, was<br \/>er zu wissen brauchte
        f\u00fcr die dunkle Kunst des T\u00f6tens. Seinen ersten Auftrag durfte er
        bereits nach<br \/>drei Jahren erledigen und er stellte sich gut an. Das war
        seine Zukunft. Doch er war noch lange nicht<br \/>soweit. Dion \u2013 so nannte
        er sich nun \u2013 w\u00fcrde seine Kunst perfektionieren m\u00fcssen, um
        sich an jenen<br \/>zu r\u00e4chen, die ihm alles nahmen.<\/p>\n","entry_parsed":"\n<p>Vor
        einigen Jahren trug sich in den heruntergekommenen Randbezirken von ______________

        \/>\u201eBeeil dich, Pelaios, sonst sind die besten Pl\u00e4tze weg!\u201c,
        rief ein junger Tiefling seinem kleinen Bruder<br \/>zu. Schnell versuchte
        der J\u00fcngere Akmenos aufzuholen. Doch als er merkte, dass dies kein Leichtes<br
        \/>war, beschloss er eine Abk\u00fcrzung zu nehmen und verschwand in einer
        dunklen Seitengasse, wo er<br \/>\u00fcber M\u00fcll und tote Ratten h\u00fcpfen
        musste. Sein vor Aufregung wedelnder Schweif schlug immer<br \/>wieder gegen
        die Hausw\u00e4nde in dem engen Durchgang. Er war erst acht Jahre alt und
        hatte das Ding,<br \/>das er hinter sich her schleifte noch nicht so unter
        Kontrolle, wie Akmenos, der fast doppelt so alt<br \/>war, wie er. Pelaios
        konnte das helle Licht am anderen Ende schon sehen und als er auf die Stra\u00dfe<br
        \/>stolperte, rannte er direkt in eine gro\u00dfe Traube von Leuten, die sich
        hier versammelt hatte. \u201eAuch<br \/>schon da?\u201c, ert\u00f6nte es hinter
        dem kleinen Tiefling mit einem Hauch von \u00dcberheblichkeit. \u201eIch warte<br
        \/>hier schon seit Ewigkeiten.\u201c, sagte Akmenos und entbl\u00f6\u00dfte
        seinen scharfen Z\u00e4hne, als er so tat, als<br \/>w\u00fcrde er g\u00e4hnen.
        Die goldenen Augen des Kleineren stierten w\u00fctend in die Roten des anderen.
        \u201eTu<br \/>nicht so, als w\u00e4rst du schon seit Stunden hier.\u201c,
        sagte er beleidigt und verschr\u00e4nkte die Arme.<br \/>Akmenos grinste nur
        und wuschelte ihm durch das blutrote Haar. \u201e Na komm.\u201c Er lotste
        ihn in eine<br \/>Seitenstra\u00dfe, die genau so verwahrlost war, wie alles
        im Teufelsdorf.<br \/>So nannten die Menschen den Randbezirk, in den die Obrigkeit
        die anwohnenden Tieflinge<br \/>vor vielen Jahren versto\u00dfen hatte. Es
        war ein Ort voller Armut, Krankheit und einer hohen<br \/>Kriminalit\u00e4tsrate.
        Viele nahmen \u00fcber die Zeit die Verhaltensweisen an, die ihnen zugeschrieben<br
        \/>wurden. Warum sich sittlich verhalten, wenn man ohnehin in jedermanns Auge
        ein Monster war?<br \/>Die beiden Jungen kletterten an den grob aufeinander
        gesetzten Steine eines alten und eher<br \/>ruinenhaft aussehenden Hauses
        hoch. Akmenos reichte seinem Bruder die Hand und zog ihn auf das<br \/>Dach.
        Dort oben hatten sie die perfekt Sicht auf das, was sich auf der Stra\u00dfe
        unter ihnen abspielte.<br \/>Heute war ein besonderer Tag und alle Tieflinge
        aus dem Teufelsdorf versammelten sich, um der<br \/>Verlesung der versprochenen
        Besserungen f\u00fcr den Randbezirk zu lauschen. Der F\u00fcrst hatte ihnen<br
        \/>versprochen, dass mehr in den Hausbau und in die medizinische Versorgung
        investiert werden soll.<br \/>Auch sollen sie mehr Abgaben der Ernte erhalten
        und wie jeder in der Stadt normal arbeiten d\u00fcrfen.<br \/>- 1 -<br \/>F\u00fcr
        die Erf\u00fcllung dieser Forderungen haben viele Tieflinge gek\u00e4mpft,
        aber nie wurde etwas<br \/>unternommen. Doch heute sollte es soweit sein.<br
        \/>Von hier oben hatten die beiden Jungen den perfekten Ausblick auf den Marktplatz.
        Es ert\u00f6nte ein<br \/>Horn und alle K\u00f6pfe wandten sich in die Richtung,
        von wo der Klang herkam. Auf hohen R\u00f6ssern<br \/>mit sch\u00f6nen Decken,
        auf denen das Emblem des F\u00fcrsten in goldenen Lettern aufgestickt war,
        ritt die<br \/>Stadtwache, gefolgt von einer Kutsche und einem weiteren dutzend
        Wachen auf den gro\u00dfen Platz.<br \/>Ein stattlicher Soldat mit einer goldenen
        R\u00fcstung, nahm seinen Helm ab und zog eine<br \/>Pergamentrolle aus seinem
        G\u00fcrtel. \u201eSeid gegr\u00fc\u00dft! Heute ist der Tag aller Tage. Nach
        vielen Stunden<br \/>der Beratung und Verhandlung, kam der F\u00fcrst nun
        endlich zu einem Entschluss. Es sollen endlich<br \/>Taten folgen und Ver\u00e4nderungen
        in kraft treten.\u201c Er rollt das Papier zusammen und steckt es wieder<br
        \/>weg. Er hebt langsam die Hand, w\u00e4hrend alle anwesenden gespannt auf
        die Kutsche blicken und auf<br \/>das Heraustreten des Beraters warten. \u201eAngriff!\u201c,
        ruft der Soldat.<br \/>Von allen Seiten str\u00f6men Soldaten in die Stra\u00dfen
        und Gassen. Mit schwingenden Schwertern<br \/>und Lanzen stechen sie auf die
        nichts ahnenden Tieflinge ein, die mit der Hoffnung auf Besserung<br \/>hergekommen
        waren. Es ist ein riesiges Massaker. Alles wehren hilft nichts. Die Ver\u00e4nderungen,
        die<br \/>dem F\u00fcrsten vorschweben ist die Eliminierung und Ausrottung
        des Teufelsdorfs. Egal ob Mann oder<br \/>Frau, jung oder alt, alles was den
        Soldaten in ihre rot gesprenkelten Klinge l\u00e4uft, wird ausradiert.<br
        \/>Die beiden Jungen auf dem Dach m\u00fcssen fassungslos dem Szenario, das
        sich auf den rot<br \/>gef\u00e4rbten Stra\u00dfen abspielt, zusehen. Pelaios
        kann das nicht verstehen, in ihm breitet sich Leere aus,<br \/>er f\u00fchlt
        gar nichts. Es scheint alles so unwirklich, dass es nur ein Alptraum sein
        kann. Doch als<br \/>Akmenos ihn an seine Brust zieht und fest an sich dr\u00fcckt,
        dass ihm dieses Bild voll Grauen erspart<br \/>bleibt, wird ihm klar, dass
        es sich hierbei um die Realit\u00e4t handelt. Der F\u00fcrst hatte sich die
        Hoffnung<br \/>der Tieflinge zu nutzen gemacht, um diese schlie\u00dflich
        in ihrem Blut zu ertr\u00e4nken. Das Einzige, das<br \/>Pelaios wahrnahm waren
        die Schreie und der bei\u00dfende Gestank von Blut, der sich irgendwann mit<br
        \/>Rauch vermischte. Er wollte schreien und weinen, aber er konnte nicht...<br
        \/>Irgendwann wurde es still und die schweren Schritte der Soldaten verrieten,
        dass sie ihren<br \/>Auftrag erf\u00fcllt hatten und abzogen. Pelaios sp\u00fcrte
        die warme Hand seines Bruders auf seinem Kopf,<br \/>wie sie beruhigend durch
        seine Haare streichelte. \u201eWir m\u00fcssen uns ein sicheres Versteck suchen.\u201c,<br
        \/>fl\u00fcsterte er ihm ins Ohr. \u201eVersuch nur mich anzusehen, h\u00f6rst
        du?\u201c Der Kleinere nickte kaum<br \/>merklich und l\u00f6ste sich aus
        seinen Armen.<br \/>- 2 -<br \/>Schwach versuchte Akmenos ein L\u00e4cheln
        hervorzubringen und kletterte langsam die Hauswand<br \/>hinunter. Pelaios
        wollte ihm wirklich gleich folgen, doch als er sich umdrehte, um seinem Bruder
        zu<br \/>folgen, schweifte sein Blick unwillk\u00fcrlich \u00fcber das Bild
        des Grauens. Das Leben hier war nicht<br \/>immer einfach und sch\u00f6n,
        aber es war seine Heimat und die hatte man ihm genommen. Schweigend<br \/>verlie\u00df
        er das Dach und kam neben Akmenos mit gesenktem Blick zum Stehen. Der Gr\u00f6\u00dfere
        griff<br \/>seine Hand und zog ihn durch die Stra\u00dfen, die hinter dem
        Marktplatz lagen. Auch hier konnte man<br \/>die Verw\u00fcstung sehen, aber
        nur halb so schlimm, wie im Zentrum. Er nahm seinen Bruder mit zum<br \/>\u00e4u\u00dfersten
        Rand, weit weg von allem. Es gab dort ein sehr altes Haus, dessen Dach kaum
        mehr<br \/>vorhanden war, in dem auch seit Ewigkeiten niemand mehr gewohnt
        hatte. Hier hatten die Jungen<br \/>immer R\u00e4uber gespielt.<br \/>\u201eBleib
        hier. Ich zieh los und suche etwas zu essen.\u201c, sagte Akmenos, als es
        schlie\u00dflich anfing<br \/>dunkel zu werden. Doch gerade als er gehen wollte,
        griff Pelaios nach seinem Arm. \u201eGeh nicht weg,<br \/>bitte!\u201c, flehte
        er und nun standen ihm zum ersten Mal Tr\u00e4nen in den Augen. Der \u00c4ltere
        seufzte und<br \/>ging vor ihm in die Hocke. \u201eH\u00f6r zu. Stell dir
        einfach vor, dass du unsere Diebesh\u00f6hle besch\u00fctzen<br \/>musst,
        w\u00e4hrend ich losziehe und neues Diebesgut hole. In Ordnung?\u201c Aufmunternd
        l\u00e4chelte er ihn<br \/>an und setzte dann sein ernstes R\u00e4ubergesicht
        auf. \u201eDion, pass gut auf unsere H\u00f6hle auf!\u201c Und dann<br \/>verschwand
        er. Immer wenn sie spielten, benutzten sie nie ihre richtigen Namen, sondern
        nannten<br \/>sich Dion und Kairon. Der rothaarige Junge bem\u00fchte sich
        sehr stark zu sein und so zu tun, als<br \/>w\u00fcrden sie spielen, aber
        es wurde kalt und dunkel und Akmenos \u2013 Nein, Kairon \u2013 war noch immer<br
        \/>nicht zur\u00fcck. Er hatte Angst und weinte.<br \/>Er schreckte auf, als
        er sp\u00fcrte, wie jemand eine Decke auf ihn legte. \u201eSchlaf weiter...\u201c,
        fl\u00fcsterte<br \/>Akmenos, der inzwischen wieder zur\u00fcck war. Doch
        Pelaios sch\u00fcttelte den Kopf und rutschte zu<br \/>seinem Bruder, wo er
        sich anlehnte. \u201eHier, das habe ich gefunden.\u201c, sagte er sanft und
        hielt ihm einen<br \/>Ohrring hin, der seiner Mutter geh\u00f6rt hatte. Er
        griff nach ihm und betrachtete den roten Stein daran.<br \/>\u201eIch hab
        den anderen. Siehst du?\u201c Er zeigte ihm seinen und stach ihn sich durch
        das Ohrl\u00e4ppchen.<br \/>\u201eJetzt haben wir beide etwas, das uns verbindet
        und auch mit Mutter.\u201c Pelaios begriff, was das hie\u00df.<br \/>Sie waren
        nun alleine und auf sich gestellt.<br \/>Die beiden Jungen blieben im Teufelsdorf
        in ihrer Ruine ganz am \u00e4u\u00dfersten Stadtrand, wo niemals<br \/>jemand
        vorbeikam.<br \/>- 3 -<br \/>Sie bauten sich dort ein eigenes kleines Zuhause
        auf mit den Dingen, die sie auf der Stra\u00dfe fanden<br \/>oder aus der
        Stadt stahlen. Das Dorf war nicht mehr bewohnt und dem Erdboden beinahe gleich<br
        \/>gemacht. Es standen nur noch Ruinen dort, alles andere wurde niedergebrannt.
        Ob sich noch andere<br \/>\u00fcberlebende Tieflinge hier verschanzten, wussten
        die Jungen nicht genau, aber sie vermuteten es.<br \/>Denn ab und zu, wenn
        sie durch die Stra\u00dfen schlichen, mit Kapuzenumh\u00e4ngen getarnt, vernahmen<br
        \/>sie hie und da Schatten in den alten H\u00e4usern.<br \/>Um sich ein \u00dcberleben
        zu sichern mussten sie lernen sich selbst zu versorgen und Akmenos fing an<br
        \/>sich in der Stadt zu nehmen, was er brauchte. Nur selten nahm er seinen
        Bruder mit. Er wollte ihn<br \/>besch\u00fctzen und vor \u00c4rger fernhalten.
        Zwei Jahre lebten sie so. Es war nicht einfach, aber sie hatten<br \/>genug,
        um nicht zu verhungern oder zu erfrieren.<br \/>In der Stadt hatte sich Akmenos
        mit seinen siebzehn Jahren bereits einen Namen als Dieb<br \/>gemacht. Sie
        nannten ihn den ''schwarzen Blitz''. Er war schnell und geschickt und hatte
        irgendwann<br \/>leider das Aufsehen der Obrigkeit auf sich gelenkt. Eines
        Tages erlaubte er Pelaios mitzukommen in<br \/>die Stadt und Schmiere zu stehen.
        Mit seiner Steinschleuder gewappnet ging der kleine Tiefling, der<br \/>seine
        Kapuze tief \u00fcber das Gesicht gezogen hatte, auf das Dach, um dort zu
        lauern und seinem<br \/>Bruder im Notfall zur Seite stehen zu k\u00f6nnen.
        Er wollte gerade schie\u00dfen, als ein Mann mit dem<br \/>Wappen des F\u00fcrsten
        am Umhang seinen Bruder am Arm festhielt und ihn in eine Seitenstra\u00dfe
        zog.<br \/>Doch als der Kleinere bemerkte, dass es nicht zu Streitigkeiten
        kam, sondern die beiden miteinander<br \/>sprachen, lie\u00df Pelaios die
        Steinschleuder sinken und beobachtete stattdessen das Geschehen. Es war<br
        \/>seltsam und er konnte sich auch keinen Reim daraus machen.<br \/>Als er
        Akmenos darauf ansprach, wich er ihm aus und gab ihm keine richtige Antwort
        \u00fcber<br \/>was der Mann mit ihm gesprochen hat. Meistens sagte er nur:
        \u201eWir k\u00f6nnen froh sein, dass er mich<br \/>nicht festnehmen lassen
        hat.\u201c Irgendetwas war seltsam an der Sache und Pelaios konnte nicht<br
        \/>aufh\u00f6ren dar\u00fcber nachzudenken.<br \/>An einem Abend packte der
        \u00c4ltere, mit dem kupferfarbenen Haar, einen gro\u00dfen Beutel auf<br
        \/>den R\u00fccken und machte sich aufbruchbereit. \u201eWozu das ganze Zeug?\u201c,
        fragte Pelaios verwundert,<br \/>der gerade ein St\u00fcck Brot a\u00df. \u201eIch
        habe heute etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferes vor. Bleib du hier.\u201c, antwortete
        er.<br \/>Pelaios nickte und lie\u00df ihn ziehen. Seit er ihn in der Stadt
        mit dem Mann von dem F\u00fcrsten sprechen<br \/>sehen hat, sprach Akmenos
        kaum noch \u00fcber seine Pl\u00e4ne. Schnell schlang er sein letztes St\u00fcck
        Brot<br \/>herunter und wartete noch einen Moment, ehe er seinem Bruder folgte.<br
        \/>- 4 -<br \/>Als er ihn aufgesp\u00fcrt hatte, sah er ihn zwischen zwei
        Wachen stehen und vor ihm der Mann<br \/>mit dem Wappen des F\u00fcrsten,
        mit dem er zuvor schon einmal gesprochen hatten. In Begleitung der<br \/>bewaffneten
        M\u00e4nner gingen sie in ein nobel aussehendes Haus. Mit leisen Schritten
        folgte ihnen<br \/>Pelaios. Durch ein Fenster konnte er ein B\u00fcro sehen,
        in dem die M\u00e4nner an einem Tisch standen.<br \/>Doch der junge Tiefling
        konnte nichts h\u00f6ren. Gl\u00fccklicherweise hatte ihm sein Bruder gezeigt,
        wie<br \/>man Fenster \u00f6ffnet und er machte sich an dem Fenster des Nebenzimmers
        zu schaffen. Als er es<br \/>tats\u00e4chlich \u00f6ffnen konnte, trat er
        hinein und schlich sich an das B\u00fcro heran, um an der T\u00fcre zu<br
        \/>lauschen. \u201eIch schw\u00f6re mit meinem Leben, dass ich dem F\u00fcrst
        treu ergeben sein werde. Ich schw\u00f6re,<br \/>dass ich f\u00fcr ihn auskundschaften
        und morden werde. Hiermit lege ich meinen Eid ab und sollte ich<br \/>ihn
        jemals brechen, soll mein Kopf zu seinen F\u00fc\u00dfen liegen.\u201c Pelaios
        Augen weiteten sich, als ihm klar<br \/>wurde, dass das die Stimme seines
        Bruders war, die dort sprach. Ohne nachzudenken riss er die T\u00fcre<br \/>auf.
        \u201eWas tust du denn da?!\u201c Alle anwesenden drehten sich zu dem Eindringling
        um und starrten ihn<br \/>an. \u201eWer ist das?\u201c, fragte der Mann irritiert
        und befahl er seinen Wachen: \u201eT\u00f6tet ihn!\u201c Erschrocken<br \/>riss
        er die Augen auf, als die beiden Wachen mit erhobenen Schwerten auf ihn zukamen.<br
        \/>\u201eAkmenos!\u201c, schrie der junge Tiefling. Doch sein Bruder wendete
        das Gesicht von ihm ab und sagte<br \/>leise: \u201eEs w\u00e4re besser, wenn
        du fliehst.\u201c Pelaios konnte es nicht fassen und streckte die Hand nach<br
        \/>seinem Bruder aus. \u201eAber...\u201c Er konnte nicht weiter sprechen.
        \u201eVerschwinde!\u201c, br\u00fcllte Akmenos ihn<br \/>an und das tat er.
        Er drehte sich um und rannte so schnell er konnte fort.<br \/>Sein Bruder
        tauchte nie wieder bei ihm auf. Anfangs hatte er noch die Hoffnung, dass er
        sich<br \/>das nur eingebildet hatte, aber die Tage gingen dahin und von Akmenos
        gab es kein Zeichen des<br \/>Zur\u00fcckkommens. Er weinte und wusste nicht,
        was er tun sollte. In seiner Verzweiflung \u00fcber sein<br \/>Ungl\u00fcck,
        seine Herkunft und wie die Leute die Tieflinge behandelten, s\u00e4gte er
        sich seine H\u00f6rner so<br \/>weit ab, wie er nur konnte. Es tat weh, aber
        es ihm das Gef\u00fchl, ein bisschen mehr, wie die Menschen<br \/>zu sein.
        Doch als die Realit\u00e4t \u00fcber ihn hereinbrach und ihm bewusst wurde,
        dass sein gro\u00dfer Bruder<br \/>ihn im Stich gelassen hatte und es nicht
        die Schuld seiner Herkunft war, sondern die der Obrigkeit,<br \/>packte ihn
        die Wut. Innerlich brannte er, wie Feuer und \u00fcber Monate hinweg breitete
        sich das<br \/>Inferno in seinem Inneren immer mehr aus. Pelaios fasste einen
        Entschluss: Er w\u00fcrde die Stadt<br \/>verlassen, einen anderen Namen annehmen
        und das Handwerk eines Assasinen erlernen. Wenn er<br \/>soweit sein w\u00fcrde,
        w\u00fcrde er ihn, seinen Bruder, finden und dann w\u00fcrde er mit ihm abrechnen.<br
        \/><br \/>Die Obrigkeit hatte ihm alles genommen, seine Heimat, seine Eltern
        und seinen Bruder. Sie<br \/>haben ihm sein Leben genommen. Er wurde kalt
        im Herzen und wurde zu dem, zu was ihn alle<br \/>machten: Ein D\u00e4mon.<br
        \/>Er lieferte ''Obscuritas'', einer Gruppe von Assassinen, den Beweis, dass
        er w\u00fcrdig sei, bei<br \/>ihnen zu lernen. Und mit seinen dreizehn Jahren
        nahmen sie ihn auf und brachten ihm alles bei, was<br \/>er zu wissen brauchte
        f\u00fcr die dunkle Kunst des T\u00f6tens. Seinen ersten Auftrag durfte er
        bereits nach<br \/>drei Jahren erledigen und er stellte sich gut an. Das war
        seine Zukunft. Doch er war noch lange nicht<br \/>soweit. Dion \u2013 so nannte
        er sich nun \u2013 w\u00fcrde seine Kunst perfektionieren m\u00fcssen, um
        sich an jenen<br \/>zu r\u00e4chen, die ihm alles nahmen.<\/p>\n","image":"characters\/k1hNDK5wHJYQ3zUyDSneecolDv0DKwkgHKprPwpw.jpeg","focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"image_full":"https:\/\/images.kanka.io\/user\/hUn3ERL8LOIyT236SB-9EUizWU4=\/smart\/src\/characters%2Fk1hNDK5wHJYQ3zUyDSneecolDv0DKwkgHKprPwpw.jpeg?webpfallback","image_thumb":"https:\/\/images.kanka.io\/user\/1hxcbhH_bhYT7yaHvQ0Pp-Q_obU=\/40x40\/smart\/src\/characters%2Fk1hNDK5wHJYQ3zUyDSneecolDv0DKwkgHKprPwpw.jpeg?webpfallback","has_custom_image":true,"header_full":"","has_custom_header":false,"is_private":false,"is_template":false,"entity_id":12073,"tags":[24197,19193],"created_at":"2018-04-03T19:58:48.000000Z","created_by":null,"updated_at":"2019-08-09T10:35:32.000000Z","updated_by":1,"location_id":930,"title":"Spymaster
