        an essay by Vash Xhalieron defending the usefulness of a society for necromancy.
        It goes into the details of how various cultures and societies have viewed
        and used necromancy in the past.<\/p>\n<p>He argues that necromancy can be
        useful in legal matters - knowing who committed a crime, what to do in case
        of an inheritance and no will is present, or finding family heirlooms lost
        to an untimely death.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He argues against necromancy by stating
        that robbing life of an unquestionably truth; death; will destroy the fabric
        of society, as examples in the past have shown. The most notably one is the
        Essem Empire (Northen Beidra) that collapsed in complete revolt when factions
        killed heirs to the thrown but they all kept coming back to life. He also
        argues that wealth accumulates a lot stronger, as wealth isn''t split up between
        individuals on a person''s death. Elves have overcome this problem by having
        a shared system of wealth, but in a society where private property exists,
        it creates many problems.<\/p>\n<p>He disregards the moral argument as being

        to an untimely death.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He argues against necromancy by stating
        that robbing life of an unquestionably truth; death; will destroy the fabric
        of society, as examples in the past have shown. The most notably one is the
        Essem Empire (Northen Beidra) that collapsed in complete revolt when factions
        killed heirs to the thrown but they all kept coming back to life. He also
        argues that wealth accumulates a lot stronger, as wealth isn''t split up between
        individuals on a person''s death. Elves have overcome this problem by having
        a shared system of wealth, but in a society where private property exists,
        it creates many problems.<\/p>\n<p>He disregards the moral argument as being
