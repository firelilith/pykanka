        I know where the temple is. Thing is, I need that temple for me and my faction

        about this. You get the temple back, bring it back to Arcastle, and be the
        heroes of the realm. You all want to be heroes, right? But in exchange, I
        need a few things. I\u2019m not asking much, really, and I think this is a
        good deal. I\u2019ll shut up about you stealing from the Prince, so that\u2019s
        two great deals for you. But in exchange, I want you to help me put my people
        in the Temple in Arcastle. Your sister is the head of it, and you Master Lex

        man, and I know a lot of things. But I only have so many hours every day,
        and they are all devoted to the people of Rosen. And my people are the same.
        Very strong and knowledgeable, but very busy. Now, there are a few items.
        Not even sure if they exist, but items of legends that I know of. You see
        where this is going? I am a curious man, and I want to know more about these
        items. I want them. You know what I\u2019m going to ask you, don\u2019t you?
        I want you guys to run around for me and find me these items, and bring them
        to me. Or bring me information you find. You can keep all the gold and items
        you find on your searches, but all I ask for is the items I set you out to
        get for me. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>See? That\u2019s not a bad deal. I\u2019d
        say it\u2019s a great deal, especially for you. You become heroes, travel
        the world, visit many amazing people and places, find treasure, and in exchange,
        you just need to give my people access to the temple, and find a few items
        for me. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t work for me every day. I\u2019ll
        just need you from time to time, when I have enough information. So that I
        don\u2019t waste your time.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>He takes a sip of his wine, gets
        up, followed by his guards, goes out of the room, and before closing the door,

        will start a ritual by placing some gems around the temple. After 10 minutes
        of meditating, a radiant light expands from his hands, going from gem to gem,
        surrounding the temple, before it shrinks into a tiny shape. Bjorn puts it
        in a glass bottle and closes it. As soon as the glass is opened, the temple
        will expand quickly and revert to its original form. Be very careful.<\/p>\n<p>The
        players should now go back to Arcastle.<\/p>\n<h3>Othiria Spies<\/h3>\n<p>Spies
        of Orithia have been waiting for the party to find out things about the temple
        and following them. One night when the group sleeps, they will steal the bottle
        from whoever is carrying it.<\/p>\n<p>Ask the players for the order of guard,
        and decide when the spies attack. Casting silence on whoever is in charge?
        Casting entangle? Just very sneaky?<\/p>\n<p>They wake up without the bottle
        (if they even pay attention). Follows up a classic case of chase. Nature check
        to find tracks. Roll determines how long they need to find tracks. They eventually
        find fresh horse tracks leading towards a river or a sea, whatever is closest.<\/p>\n<p>This
        leads the players through a small and very quite village. They see a hanging
        man just out of the village, as a warning of some kind. The man was killed
        the same day.<\/p>\n<h3>Longclaw<\/h3>\n<p>Thieves in Longclaw have taken
        advantage of the guards being called to the capital, and have taken over.
        They charge a hefty sum to anyone walking by. Their leader, a human named
        Barick, if suspecting the players of being worth of ransom, will charge his
        men to capture them (10 humans surrounding the party\u2019s carriage, not
        a great challenge). As soon as 3 or 4 of his men die, he calls the attack
        off: \u201cOkay, how about you just pay us 200 gold and we let you pass?\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As
        this point, the village bell rings. A man has escaped from the prison set
        up by the villagers, and is running away. The remaining villagers all start
        chasing him \u201cDon\u2019t let him escape!\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>He is one of
        the spies of Othiria, the second one hanging in front of the village. They
        went to the village to try and get a boat of some sorts to avoid the roads.
        He and his friend were caught by the villages and imprisoned for having no
        items of value on them. The other guy was killed since he said he hat no family,
        so they guessed they wouldn\u2019t get a ransome. This tells the 2nd spy that
        this is way out of hand. These villagers seems bloodlust. He will give back
        his stuff to the party in exchange for being let go, no charges. He just lost
        his brother, and just wants to bring him home for a proper funeral...<\/p>\n<p>He
        has hidden his things in a cave nearby. When they arrive there, his horse
        is dead, as if one half was eaten off by something giant\u2026 And out of
        the cave come out <strong>2 Hill Giants<\/strong> (CR5, 5\u2019400xp). The
        guy\u2019s loot is in the cave.<\/p>\n<h3>The Caravans<\/h3>\n<p>If required
        from a time standpoint, have the players meet 20 caravans of people in not
        great condition going direction north, presumably running away from the orcs
        ravaging the countryside. A women with a baby in her arms says \u201call hope

        her village. <strong>RP stuff<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Arcastle<\/h3>\n<p>After

        in the castle, go and see the king.<\/p>\n<p>Richard is waiting for the party
        at the gates. He heard of their arrival from an outpost. He spent the last
        2 weeks fighting off orc attacks, clearing out the area and protecting the
        villages nearby. Most people have left the villages for the guarded cities,

        reward from his father, regardless of the results, a bottle of Aleport Ale.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the exam ends, a beaten up man on a horse arrives, saying his small village
        30min from here was attacked by orcs. The king will send his daughter and
        her friends to take care of it, despite Isolde arguing \u201c<em>she\u2019s

        look coordinated.<\/p>\n<p>On their way to the camp, they fight off 3 basilisks.<\/p>\n<p>Small
        orc camp with 2 stronger guards first and 5 normal orcs afterwards (should
        be pretty easy). They are not enraged, but are confused. They don\u2019t feel

        that a white crow is following the party since a while. It will lead them
        through the forests nearby.<\/p>\n<p>The crow continues to guide the party,
        until they approach a small house.<\/p>\n<h3>Bringing shame to the family<\/h3>\n<p>In
        the house, there are light curtains, and looking just through the windows,

        Sanctuary<\/h3>\n<p>The players can visit a small local shrine of Pelor, called
        <strong>Pelor\u2019s Sanctuary<\/strong>. It is a small dark wood structure,
        with thick glass on the outside. Inside, the priest <strong>Brother Garrat<\/strong>.
        He will sense Pelor\u2019s influence on Hilde and Lex. He will invite them
        to a Bath of Cleaning. One person at a time, they can enter the cold, thick
        yellow liquid. It is expected that they wait at the bottom of the small well.
        They must breath the water to feel like they are dying, to finally feel the
        warmth and open their eyes in another plane. They are naked, floating in the
        sky. It is bright, and yellow clouds expand in all directions. A ball of light\/fire
        comes slowly, and once close to the player, they will see a white mark on
        the ball.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hilde<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>My child, my sweet
        child, you have done a great deed in bringing my temple back to the Magic

        so I can fight off the darkness.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>You are one of my chosen

        But beware of the path you wish to pursue once the night has fallen. My light
        brights even the darkest of places, and I keep a close eye on my heroes. And
        beware of the shadows who follow you, they are of great evil. Destroy those
        shadows, and I shall reward you greatly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The players than grasp
        for air as they emerge back from the pool. Garrat hands them a yellow towel
        for them to get clean, and wishes the players a good stay in Drunah. \u201c<em>Beware
        of the shadows\u201d<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>Market<\/h3>\n<p><em>Hilde bought a
        Tambourin for 6gp from a merchant. She asked for sheets, but he told her to
        come to his shop tomorrow. The shop is in the same village as Dalton\u2019s
        house.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Auron bought Leaky Dark Beer (350ml) for 5sp.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Lex
        wanted to buy a healing potion for 70 GP, but didn\u2019t want to pay.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Tavern<\/h3>\n<p>The
        players can enjoy the taverns and inns, including the baths, heated water.
        The pools are separated by sex. Hildegard could be approached at that point
        by Vaeri, the drow woman. Have a privat talk with her. She will casually ask
        Hilde where she is from, who she\u2019s here with, what are her personal goals.
        Hilde should be interested in this NPC and ask her questions. Vaeri (passing
        simply as Nysah) will mention coming from \u201c<strong>Dokuz<\/strong>\u201d,
        a land Hilde or the others never heard about. \u201cIt\u2019s behind the glass
        mountains.\u201d After a few questions, she will leave \u201cwell, it\u2019s
        been a pleasure\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Beautiful Tiefling<\/h3>\n<p>While walking
        in the city, Auron will notice a female Tiefling, the first he sees other
        than the ones at the orphanage. She has long golden hair, a light purple skin
        tone, a beautiful body covered in runes and markings. They can try and follow
        her. <strong>Charisma Valla<\/strong> is a warlock, part of the Magic Guild,
        where she is in training.<\/p>\n<p>She can notice the players, and invite
        Auron to a drink \u201c<em>not often you see another Tiefling here<\/em>\u201d.
        During the interaction, she asks Auron, seeing as he is strong, to help her
        with something. She was tasked to study the the Sinking Temple. She found
        the temple, but she couldn\u2019t get in \u201c<em>the doors were blocked
        and I wasn\u2019t strong enough<\/em>\u201d. In exchange for getting the info,
        \u201c<em>I shall reward you like a hero<\/em>\u201d with a wink. If he accepts,
        he will get the info where the temple is (1 day carriage and one day walk
        through the sinking wetlands). Her colleagues went into the temple a few months
        ago, but didn\u2019t come out. They are probably dead, but she needs to know
        what happened to them.<\/p>\n<h3>A meeting with the king<\/h3>\n<p>At some
        point where the players are doing something (maybe when they are drunk), the
        same guard will come for them, even if it\u2019s at 3 am. \u201c<em>The King
        is waiting for you\u201d<\/em>. They are to come now. He will lead them the
        castle walls. They will have to leave weapons, bags, armour, everything except

        is currently building fortifications around the city, since they\u2019ve never
        needed any before. Guards are stationed at the entrances to the city, and
        ask the party what their business is. They don\u2019t seem to be expecting
        them, and want to make sure they aren\u2019t mercenaries trying to get into

        Sanctuary<\/h3>\n<p>The players can visit a small local shrine of Pelor, called
        <strong>Pelor\u2019s Sanctuary<\/strong>. It is a small dark wood structure,
        with thick glass on the outside. Inside, the priest <strong>Brother Garrat<\/strong>.
        He will sense Pelor\u2019s influence on Hilde and Lex. He will invite them
        to a Bath of Cleaning. One person at a time, they can enter the cold, thick
        yellow liquid. It is expected that they wait at the bottom of the small well.
        They must breath the water to feel like they are dying, to finally feel the
        warmth and open their eyes in another plane. They are naked, floating in the
        sky. It is bright, and yellow clouds expand in all directions. A ball of light\/fire
        comes slowly, and once close to the player, they will see a white mark on
        the ball.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hilde<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>My child, my sweet
        child, you have done a great deed in bringing my temple back to the Magic

        so I can fight off the darkness.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>You are one of my chosen

        brights even the darkest of places, and I keep a close eye on my heroes. And
        beware of the shadows who follow you, they are of great evil. Destroy those
        shadows, and I shall reward you greatly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The players than grasp
        for air as they emerge back from the pool. Garrat hands them a yellow towel
        for them to get clean, and wishes the players a good stay in Drunah. \u201c<em>Beware
        of the shadows\u201d<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>Market<\/h3>\n<p><em>Hilde bought a
        Tambourin for 6gp from a merchant. She asked for sheets, but he told her to
        come to his shop tomorrow. The shop is in the same village as Dalton\u2019s
        house.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Auron bought Leaky Dark Beer (350ml) for 5sp.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Lex
        wanted to buy a healing potion for 70 GP, but didn\u2019t want to pay.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Tavern<\/h3>\n<p>The
        players can enjoy the taverns and inns, including the baths, heated water.
        The pools are separated by sex. Hildegard could be approached at that point
        by Vaeri, the drow woman. Have a privat talk with her. She will casually ask
        Hilde where she is from, who she\u2019s here with, what are her personal goals.
        Hilde should be interested in this NPC and ask her questions. Vaeri (passing
        simply as Nysah) will mention coming from \u201c<strong>Dokuz<\/strong>\u201d,
        a land Hilde or the others never heard about. \u201cIt\u2019s behind the glass
        mountains.\u201d After a few questions, she will leave \u201cwell, it\u2019s
        been a pleasure\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Beautiful Tiefling<\/h3>\n<p>While walking
        in the city, Auron will notice a female Tiefling, the first he sees other
        than the ones at the orphanage. She has long golden hair, a light purple skin
        tone, a beautiful body covered in runes and markings. They can try and follow
        her. <strong>Charisma Valla<\/strong> is a warlock, part of the Magic Guild,
        where she is in training.<\/p>\n<p>She can notice the players, and invite
        Auron to a drink \u201c<em>not often you see another Tiefling here<\/em>\u201d.
        During the interaction, she asks Auron, seeing as he is strong, to help her
        with something. She was tasked to study the the Sinking Temple. She found
        the temple, but she couldn\u2019t get in \u201c<em>the doors were blocked
        and I wasn\u2019t strong enough<\/em>\u201d. In exchange for getting the info,
        \u201c<em>I shall reward you like a hero<\/em>\u201d with a wink. If he accepts,
        he will get the info where the temple is (1 day carriage and one day walk
        through the sinking wetlands). Her colleagues went into the temple a few months
        ago, but didn\u2019t come out. They are probably dead, but she needs to know
        what happened to them.<\/p>\n<h3>A meeting with the king<\/h3>\n<p>At some
        point where the players are doing something (maybe when they are drunk), the
        same guard will come for them, even if it\u2019s at 3 am. \u201c<em>The King

        war, so he asks how he can protect the people of Othiria who are against the
        King.<\/p>\n<p>The house gets attacked in the evening by 3 Shadow Demons (mm64,
        6600xp) controlled by someone else. If the monsters don\u2019t work, 3 Knights

        Once back in Redford, the party can have a meeting directly with Dalton and
        Seathan. Reports say that King Maximus von Rosenberg say he is on his way
        with a small regiment of about 800 men, and has told Sethan to not resist,
        and he will be there in one day. He says his brother has crossed a line that
        will destroy the country with this action.<\/p>\n<p><em>Lex made a 60 gp donation

        criminal work, and to protect his mother from harm he fled to Dulken).<\/p>\n<p>Maximus
        will ask the players the whole situation, and then meet with Sethan. He wants
        to punish Bathair for hurting his daughter, a diplomatic envoy, and the nonsense
        of the peace deal.<\/p>\n<p><em>Maximus have Levin as guard for this mission,
        and takes Levin with him to meet Seaphan.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sethan at this point
        will agree to side with the rebels. They talk about essentially a Parliamentary
        Monarchy (King exists but has a lesser role in the management of the kingdom).<\/p>\n<p>Maximus
        is okay to not cause harm to Othiria if the king is dealt with fast, and that
        the new government of Othiria is an ally of Arden.<\/p>\n<p>After everyone
        agrees to work together, the next step is to take care of the mad king. To
        seal the support of Arden in the people of Othiria, They should go with Sethan
        to take care of the king, and use force if needed. Sethan will declare himself
        the new king of Othiria and propose an elected parliament who takes care of
        politics.<\/p>\n<p>At that point, an envoy comes in and warns \u201c<em>8\u2019000

        Othiria have no real peace treaty, and none of the girls with the king was
        Thasslian nobility. So Hilde should be able to haven audience. She should

        saved by Jake, who is working with people from Redford with Dalton and Jaddon.
        Went to a house where Jaddon is waiting for them.<\/p>\n<h2>Setup 20:00<\/h2>\n<p>The

        with his guard\/friend, and will tell the players he is here to get people
        to join the revolution for his idea of a new type of government, controlled
        by the people. He realises that the King trying to imprison the princess means
        war, so he asks how he can protect the people of Othiria who are against the
        King.<\/p>\n<p>The house gets attacked in the evening by 3 Shadow Demons (mm64,
        6600xp) controlled by someone else. If the monsters don\u2019t work, 3 Knights
        + 1 half-red dragon veteran (mm180, 7\u2019800xp) will attack them \u201cfor
        the king of Othiria, Bathair MacPhaiden!\u201d. They should probably kill
        them, or they will report to the king.<\/p>\n<p>One of the diplomats, now
        also there, tells Maxi that the prisoner was spotted in Redford, so he\u2019s
        probably still in the city, so he should travel with the party.<\/p>\n<h3>Redford<\/h3>\n<p>(21:30)
        Once back in Redford, the party can have a meeting directly with Dalton and
        Seathan. Reports say that King Maximus von Rosenberg say he is on his way
        with a small regiment of about 800 men, and has told Sethan to not resist,
        and he will be there in one day. He says his brother has crossed a line that
        will destroy the country with this action.<\/p>\n<p><em>Lex made a 60 gp donation
        to the Shrine of Pelor in Redford.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>(22:45) When the party meets
        Maximus, he will give a letter to Auron from his Father regarding Charlie
        and her dead son (who he helped leave Redford because he was caught in some
        criminal work, and to protect his mother from harm he fled to Dulken).<\/p>\n<p>Maximus
        will ask the players the whole situation, and then meet with Sethan. He wants
        to punish Bathair for hurting his daughter, a diplomatic envoy, and the nonsense
        of the peace deal.<\/p>\n<p><em>Maximus have Levin as guard for this mission,
        and takes Levin with him to meet Seaphan.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sethan at this point
        will agree to side with the rebels. They talk about essentially a Parliamentary
        Monarchy (King exists but has a lesser role in the management of the kingdom).<\/p>\n<p>Maximus
        is okay to not cause harm to Othiria if the king is dealt with fast, and that
        the new government of Othiria is an ally of Arden.<\/p>\n<p>After everyone
        agrees to work together, the next step is to take care of the mad king. To
        seal the support of Arden in the people of Othiria, They should go with Sethan
        to take care of the king, and use force if needed. Sethan will declare himself
        the new king of Othiria and propose an elected parliament who takes care of
        politics.<\/p>\n<p>At that point, an envoy comes in and warns \u201c<em>8\u2019000

        Situation<\/h3>\n<p>Since the players have shown themselves worthy of Diplomatic
        missions, Maximus sends them to Drunah anyway, with the goal of taking care
        of the king, and finding out what Thasslia\u2019s goals are. Thasslia and
        Othiria have no real peace treaty, and none of the girls with the king was
        Thasslian nobility. So Hilde should be able to haven audience. She should
        contact Maximus with her power as soon as they have info. Dion will be sent

        recognise Jaddon and one of the diplomats, but not Jake. Hilde locats Jake
        north of Drunah, 30min walk. Warn him, and go back to the carriage to prepare.
        They all pray together for Pelor. Auron feels a little bit of warmth inside.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>They

        the city square, passing by Jaddon etc. At 18:00, Callum is wearing his fighting
        clothes, as is his son. The two girls with Bathair exit the castle and approach
        Callum. They are both bruised up. The younger one still doesn\u2019t speak,
        but the older one says \u201cKing Bathair MacPhaiden, Ruler of Othiria, True
        Heir to the Kingdom of Herun, challenges Callum Pryde, Ruler of Thasslia,
        usurper weakling to a duel to the death. Once Bathair kills Callum Pryde,
        he will take over control of Thasslia to reform the Kingdom of Herun.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Callum
        accepts to give up his claim and abandon his kingdom, on the condition that
        his son fights against Bathair. His son looks just as determined as his father,
        but a good insight check can tell he is frightened. \u201cIf my son can\u2019t
        defeat our enemies, he isn\u2019t fit to rule Thasslia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The
        fight is tence, the child is fast and takes frequent cuts in Bathair, who
        isn\u2019t fast enough to defend himself, and his attacks are sloppy. But
        Beinon doesn\u2019t want to kill him. Bathair is out of breath, bleeding from
        many places, and can barely stand. Beinon looks at his father, who says \u201cWhat
        are you waiting for? Finish it already\u201d. The son doesn\u2019t want to
        kill and old man, asking Bathair to abandon his kingdom to save his life.<\/p>\n<p>This
        makes Callum infuriated. Bathair refuses and is on his knees. Callum approaches
        his son, takes his sword and pushed him to the floor. He lifts the sword,
        ready to behead Bathair, when two very long blue-purple arms wrap Callum,
        who lets go of his sword in surprise, and is dragged to the youngest of Bathair\u2019s
        girls.<\/p>\n<p>Bathair takes this distraction to stab Beinon with a blade
        (the same he used on Hildegard). Callum appears from behind the crows \u201cThat\u2019s
        not me!\u201d (perception check for everyone, 2nd girl is no longer there),
        so the guards aren\u2019t sure what to do. The real callum says \u201cof course
        i\u2019m the real me! What is this??!\u201d. The girl holding Callum is now
        in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aidedd.org\/dnd\/monstres.php?vo=doppelganger\"><strong>doppelganger
        <\/strong><\/a>form, and jumps to Bathair, who cuts his neck open. The fake
        callum joins the other two, transforms into a doppelganger, and fight against
        the party, as no one has any idea what is going on.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hilde tells
        bathair \u201cthe real bathair should fight me like a man\u201d, to which
        he replies \u201cBathair MacPhaiden is dead!\u201d. Hilde thinks the doppelgangers

        Lex takes the string out. \u201cTHis is beyond you\u201d. Hilde comes in ,
        asks lex if he can also feel that Pelor is weak. He also feels it. Hilde wants
        to go as fast as possible to the temple in Drunah to pray to Pelor. Lex casts
        daylight, and prays again, and sees the temple in drunah burnt to the ground,
        with the priest dead. Dion once told Auron that Callum Pryde hates religion.
        Hilde asks Nyssah if she knows anything about it, and Nyssah replies \u201cIt
        is known that callum hates religion\u201d. Hilde questions to Nyssah about

        be enemies, and that they will meet again. Hilde prays afterwards and cries

        up). Players can try and get info, but the men will say them \u201cthis is
        a siege, you\u2019d be best to run away before you get killed\u201d. Men are
        lying on the floor from both sides, but mostly from Drunah. Some men who were

        should know since they ran away from the siege of Arcastle. He says he is
        here for the head of Bathair, to become the king of Herun. Bathair must die
        for him to become the new king, uncontested. If the players question him about
        Sethan, they reply? \u201cYou must have left before it happened. Sethan and
        his children are all dead, or all except Ashlei, but I\u2019m less afraid

        point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners,
        and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears
        must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on
        a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that
        ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20

        solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet

        within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, appearing on
        whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has
        AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
        necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon

        point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners,
        and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears
        must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on
        a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that
        ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20
        miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon
        uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.<\/li>\n<li>Jagged ice
        shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that
        the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack
        roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6)
        piercing damage.<\/li>\n<li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a
        solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet
        long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature
        within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, appearing on
        whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has
        AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
        necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon
        uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><h4>End

        characters'' home island of\u00a0[location:96254]\u00a0has recently been mostly
        taken over by some strange Organisation. With the help of their families and
        friends from their village of [location:96649], the players managed to flee\u00a0with
        a goal of getting stronger, finding allies, and liberating their village.
        They''ve spent the last six months in the capital of the island, the small
        and quiet town of\u00a0[location:96258]\u00a0investigating leads, doing odd
        jobs, and trying to survive.<\/p>\n<p>During those six months, Kitty and Kyrion
        teamed up with Nyx and \"the warforged\" to liberate their homeland. They''ve
        had news from their families that they are safe, but undergo forced labour
        crafting equipment and tools for the Organisation. Some people have died when
        they tried to escape the villages, and they have little communication with
        the outside world. The families don''t fear for their lives, but are scared
        that their children get hurt or worse by trying to help out.<\/p>\n<p>Port
        Giza has suffered a few minor attacks but so far has been able to defend itself.
        There is a growing fear among the inhabitants that it won''t be long before
        the Organisation takes over their home too. Those who could afford to flee
        did, either to the closest city of\u00a0[location:96294], or further to the
        continent. One such person to run away was the previous ruler of the Port
        Giza, Lady\u00a0[character:100997], who left a month ago believing that all
        hope was lost. She of course took the coffers of the town with her and a few
        of her workers, and hasn''t been seen since. One of her adviser who stayed
        behind, the limping firbolg\u00a0[character:96292], vowed to protect the port
        and liberate the island, but has little political allies to do so at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>The
        party was recently tasked by the dwarf\u00a0[location:96258]\u00a0where he
        breeds poisonous frogs for their bile. Ever since the invasion occurred, he
        has not went (dared to) go back, and fears the situation has gotten out of
        hand and might cause a bigger problem with an secondary invasion of poisonous
        frogs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Goals<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul><li>Build trust among the

        ago. I made sure you would remember when I killed that mage Dion hired to
        erase your memories of that night. This little gift in you is already having

        Dragons and Giants no longer possess much power in this world. The war was
        a time of constant destruction and chaos. Thankfully the last giant king was
        sealed into a diamond for eternity. Should he be released, the energy could
        wake up the old magic of the giants once again.<\/li>\n<li>Regarding the curse,
        she was tasked by Dion many moons ago to see if Auron and Levin were \"damaged\"
        by Kairon, but she was looking for more general curses. If Auron comes, she
        could perform a new ritual more targeted at this kind of power.\n<ul><li>Two
        powerful entities are fighting for Auron''s devotion. Tiamat''s grasp on him
        is deep, but his heart belongs to Tormaa. Who is Tormaa? She is batteling
        to keep Tiamat''s grasp in check.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Could craft items
        to detect fey children, as the coven has dealt with hags before. They could
        sacrifice some of the children and put their eyes into jars, enchant them,

        embraced the flames and collected many gems. The party then travelled to the

        teeth, leading the party to the Halls of Selderin. Inside the falls, they
        found a portal mechanism\/puzzle. While some were investigating the portal
        and the magic tea pot, Auron decided to, upon recognising a centuries old
        artefact, to break it in two and bring half of it back. Once in the Private
        Study, they found the catalyst the party was searching for, along with books
        and notes about magic way beyond zook''s comprehension. Auron found a gem

        castle, where he has no access. He mentions a book named <strong>The Forgotten
        Secrets of Restoration and Serenity<\/strong>. He says he can\u2019t get at
        it since it\u2019s hidden in the castle, and he doesn\u2019t have access there.
        He offers \u201cbring me the book, and I\u2019ll tell you everything I know\u201d.
        He also says: \u201cYour friend doesn\u2019t look <em>awakened <\/em>yet\u201d,

        hand it over to a guard, who will take it away to another room, and offer
        the players to sit down and have lunch\/dinner with him. If they don\u2019t
        want to give him the book, \u201cMy house, my rules\u201d. Once eating, he
        will simply say<\/p>\n<p><em>So, you want information about the Nameless Immortals.
        What is it you desire to know?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And will give any information

        I know where the temple is. Thing is, I need that temple for me and my faction

        about this. You get the temple back, bring it back to Arcastle, and be the
        heroes of the realm. You all want to be heroes, right? But in exchange, I
        need a few things. I\u2019m not asking much, really, and I think this is a
        good deal. I\u2019ll shut up about you stealing from the Prince, so that\u2019s
        two great deals for you. But in exchange, I want you to help me put my people
        in the Temple in Arcastle. Your sister is the head of it, and you Master Lex
        also can help. My people will help with healing the wounded, they\u2019ve
        been doing it here for ever. But they will be allowed a certain amount of
        freedom to conduct their own research. That\u2019s the first thing. It\u2019s
        a pretty good deal, right?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Now, the second part, and this
        is where it gets interesting for you people. This is better than being heroes
        in my opinion. At least better than heroes of Arden. I\u2019m a very busy
        man, and I know a lot of things. But I only have so many hours every day,
        and they are all devoted to the people of Rosen. And my people are the same.
        Very strong and knowledgeable, but very busy. Now, there are a few items.
        Not even sure if they exist, but items of legends that I know of. You see
        where this is going? I am a curious man, and I want to know more about these
        items. I want them. You know what I\u2019m going to ask you, don\u2019t you?
        I want you guys to run around for me and find me these items, and bring them
        to me. Or bring me information you find. You can keep all the gold and items
        you find on your searches, but all I ask for is the items I set you out to
        get for me. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>See? That\u2019s not a bad deal. I\u2019d
        say it\u2019s a great deal, especially for you. You become heroes, travel
        the world, visit many amazing people and places, find treasure, and in exchange,
        you just need to give my people access to the temple, and find a few items
        for me. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t work for me every day. I\u2019ll
        just need you from time to time, when I have enough information. So that I
        don\u2019t waste your time.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>He takes a sip of his wine, gets
        up, followed by his guards, goes out of the room, and before closing the door,
        tells the players \u201cYou have 10 minutes\u201d. Start the timer.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When

        will start a ritual by placing some gems around the temple. After 10 minutes
        of meditating, a radiant light expands from his hands, going from gem to gem,
        surrounding the temple, before it shrinks into a tiny shape. Bjorn puts it
        in a glass bottle and closes it. As soon as the glass is opened, the temple
        will expand quickly and revert to its original form. Be very careful.<\/p>\n<p>The

        of Orithia have been waiting for the party to find out things about the temple
        and following them. One night when the group sleeps, they will steal the bottle
        from whoever is carrying it.<\/p>\n<p>Ask the players for the order of guard,

        (if they even pay attention). Follows up a classic case of chase. Nature check

        man just out of the village, as a warning of some kind. The man was killed
        the same day.<\/p>\n<h3>Longclaw<\/h3>\n<p>Thieves in Longclaw have taken
        advantage of the guards being called to the capital, and have taken over.
        They charge a hefty sum to anyone walking by. Their leader, a human named
        Barick, if suspecting the players of being worth of ransom, will charge his
        men to capture them (10 humans surrounding the party\u2019s carriage, not
        a great challenge). As soon as 3 or 4 of his men die, he calls the attack
        off: \u201cOkay, how about you just pay us 200 gold and we let you pass?\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As
        this point, the village bell rings. A man has escaped from the prison set

        the spies of Othiria, the second one hanging in front of the village. They
        went to the village to try and get a boat of some sorts to avoid the roads.
        He and his friend were caught by the villages and imprisoned for having no
        items of value on them. The other guy was killed since he said he hat no family,
        so they guessed they wouldn\u2019t get a ransome. This tells the 2nd spy that
        this is way out of hand. These villagers seems bloodlust. He will give back
        his stuff to the party in exchange for being let go, no charges. He just lost
        his brother, and just wants to bring him home for a proper funeral...<\/p>\n<p>He
        has hidden his things in a cave nearby. When they arrive there, his horse
        is dead, as if one half was eaten off by something giant\u2026 And out of
