        Northern part is by far the wealthiest place. The roads are stoned, the buildings
        kept clean, the buildings secure, some being 3 stories high. Most of the artisans

        the streets are muddy, and mostly manual labour lived here.<\/p>\n<h2>Religion<\/h2>\n<p>People

        in the winter to 28\u00b0C in the summer. Precipitations are low, and crops
        are irrigated in the neighbouring area, mostly using the Tinter river.<\/p>\n<h2>Government<\/h2>\n<p>The
        city is governed by an council.<\/p>\n<h2>Population<\/h2>\n<p>The population
        of Newport is of about 23''600 people. Most of which are humans (&gt;80%).
        The population is pretty racist, which has driven away most other races from
        living in the city. The minority who live still live there have difficulty
        getting basic administrative needs, and most decide to go live in the country
        site, or in other placed like Feniton\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/kanka.io\/en\/campaign\/1\/locations\/5177\">Enida<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Economy<\/h2>\n<p>The
        economy is pretty rich for the region, with about 30% of the income coming
        from trade, while most of the rest comes from farming.<\/p>\n<h3>North<\/h3>\n<p>The
        Northern part is by far the wealthiest place. The roads are stoned, the buildings
        kept clean, the buildings secure, some being 3 stories high. Most of the artisans
        and traders are located here.<\/p>\n<h3>South<\/h3>\n<p>The Southern part
        of the city is pretty squalid. Wooden houses and warehouses mingle together,
        the streets are muddy, and mostly manual labour lived here.<\/p>\n<h2>Religion<\/h2>\n<p>People
        can freely follow any religion they want. The biggest church is headed by\u00a0<a
        href=\"http:\/\/dnd.loc\/index.php?title=Lorenas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Lorenas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Crime<\/h2>\n<p>The

        for control, and little done by the city government.<\/p>\n<h3>Notable Gangs<\/h3>\n<ul><li><a

        city is mostly known for its cuisine and music, influenced by the very mixed
        population heritage. Other important industries are the logistics industries,
        along with luxury furniture using the natural resources from the villages

        style=\"font-weight:400;\">Freedom of religion is strongly supported in Feniton,

        biggest pantheon is Waukeem, Goddess of Trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many

        his followers centuries ago. It has long since been abandoned, but the remains
        of the temple has still somehow survived to this day.<\/p>\n<p>The floors
        are usually stone tiles, and the ceilings a mix of stone and wood. The ceiling
        is wood, and has several structural problems, but the wholes in the ceiling
        allow for the inside of the temple to be dimly lit.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Entrance<\/h2>\n<p>The
        entrance to the temple are fairly easy. The ground is covered in moss with
        parts of the roof colapsed. Whoever enters first must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity
        saving throw or slip on the stairs going up.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The
        roof is partially collapsed, and the tiles on the floor covered in moss. Whoever
        took care of this temple hasn''t been here in a very long time. One can imagine
        where beautiful paintings use to hang by the moss having a rectangle shape
        on the walls.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Some of the columns still have pearls
        on them. A DC 10 Strengh (Athletics) can dislocate them.<\/p>\n<p>A successfull

        golem is a small trapped door. A DC 15 Thieves Tools can open it and disarm
        the poison darts, otherwise the character must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving
        throw. On a fail, the character takes 3d6 poison damage and is poisoned. On
        a success, he takes half and isn''t poisoned.<\/p>\n<h3>C. Fountain<\/h3>\n<p>Hidden

        two\u00a0<strong>Hogboblin Boss<\/strong>\u00a0have claimed this room theirs
        and surprise the party.<\/p>\n<h3>D. Library<\/h3>\n<p>Old books covered in
        moss are still in this library. 3\u00a0<strong>Veterans<\/strong>are currently

        gold. If one dies, they rest will flee.<\/p>\n<h3>E. Preparation Room<\/h3>\n<p>What
        used to be a preparation room for the ceremony is an empty room. Under some

        floors are usually stone tiles, and the ceilings a mix of stone and wood.
        The ceiling is wood, and has several structural problems, but the wholes in
        the ceiling allow for the inside of the temple to be dimly lit.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Entrance<\/h2>\n<p>The
        entrance to the temple are fairly easy. The ground is covered in moss with
        parts of the roof colapsed. Whoever enters first must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity
        saving throw or slip on the stairs going up.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The

        the poison darts, otherwise the character must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving

        about 150 villagers. The hamlet is peaceful and friendly to all races. The
        city is famous for its wood works which are then shipped to Newport and sold
        worldwide. Recently, the woodcutting camps have been attacked. The village
        itself hasn''t been attacked yet, but people have been disappearing while
        in the forest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Townhall<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span

        of ingredients he needs for mess and healing the wounded people, but the area
        where he usually got it is depleted and he is too afraid to go into the woods
        alone to find it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When the

        Ardian Fortress was first built by human settlers from Kinross\u00a0to expand
        human control over Thaelia\u00a0during the 3rd century AC. In the fourth century
        AC, the fortress and growing city was no longer properly defended, so the
        Ardian Castle was built a few kilometres up the river, as well as a new village
        around it. During the 8th century AC, the city of Arburg and the surrounding
        villages and cities declared their own kingdom and formed Arden.<\/p>\n<p>New
        fortifications were built around the village, which is now all part of the

        is a continent on the northern hemisphere. It is bordered by the Restless
        Sea to the north, the Krehl Ocean to the east, and the Ethylian Sea to the
        south. It comprises the easternmost part of the Beiraelian super continent.<\/p>\n<p>Since
        around 300 BC, Thaelia is most commonly considered as\u00a0 separated from
        Beira by the watershed divides of the Grottur and Split Mountains, the Grotturin
        River, and the waterways of the Bay of Honnour.<\/p>\n<h3>Geography<\/h3>\n<p>Thaelia
        has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontienent.
        Its maritime borders consist of the Restless Sea to the north, the Krehl Ocean
        to the East, and the Ethylian Sea to the south. Land relief in Thaelia shows
        great variation within relatively small areas. The central regions are more
        mountainous, while moving south the terrain descends from the high Black Range
        and Andalians, through hilly uplands, while the upper half descends into broad,
        low northern plains.<\/p>\n<h3>Demographics<\/h3>\n<p>According to scholars
        and surveys, the population of Thaelia is around 18 million humanoid races.
        Estimates place the various races as follows:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Humans: 14.5 to
        15 million<\/li>\n<li>Elves: 1''000''000 to 1''200''000<\/li>\n<li>Dwarves,
