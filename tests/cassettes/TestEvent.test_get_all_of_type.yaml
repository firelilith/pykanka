        wizards of other races to help them with the food shortage problem, but none
        were successful at replenishing the land. Unrest grew, and some elves started
        attacking tieflings, gnomes and dwarves, before also attacking humans and
        eventually half-elves. They views them as part of the problem, and the sentiment
        is that these people weren''t trying to help the situation.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually,
        the kingdom mandated Harazi\u00a0the Great to survey the kingdom and find
        ways to sustain the people. Harazi was very wary, since he didn''t feel he
        had the required knowledge to allow the kingdom to sustain a population of
        over two million inhabitants. But the elves insisted, bribing Harazi''s friends
        to push him to accept. He finally did, and started surveying the land.<\/p>\n<p>Harazi
        survey the kingdom''s land and the worker, but his conclusions were the same.
        He stressed that there was no way to sustain the situation, and the people
        would face a massive starvation in the next year if nothing was done. The
        kingdom''s elite didn''t want to get rid of their utopia, so sent Harazi back
        to survey more, better, and gave him one month to find better results.<\/p>\n<p>Back
        one month later, Harazi was exhausted and worried. Knowing that nothing could
        be done, his conclusions were the same. The kingdom''s elite knew that civil
        war was but a few weeks away, and that it would be followed by a starvation.
        But Harazi came up with a solution (that was forced by the government). He
        would go to each city and village, and cast a spell on the water reserves
        that would decrease people''s hunger and calm them down.<\/p>\n<h3>Aftermath<\/h3>\n<p>Seeing
        the chaos in the cities of people attacking others, all non elfes were banned
        from the kingdom. Later, it was revealed that Harazi had tampered the water
        treatment spell and was blamed for the chaos and aftermath. His legacy was
        tarnished, and he was forced into seclusion ever since.<\/p>\n<p>All in all,
        170''000 thousand Elves and half-elves were killed, 200''000 non-elves, and
        450''000 surviving non-elves were forced out of the kingdom.<\/p>\n","entry_parsed":"\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>Frynia

        had the required knowledge to allow the kingdom to sustain a population of
        over two million inhabitants. But the elves insisted, bribing Harazi''s friends
        to push him to accept. He finally did, and started surveying the land.<\/p>\n<p>Harazi
        survey the kingdom''s land and the worker, but his conclusions were the same.
        He stressed that there was no way to sustain the situation, and the people
        would face a massive starvation in the next year if nothing was done. The
        kingdom''s elite didn''t want to get rid of their utopia, so sent Harazi back
        to survey more, better, and gave him one month to find better results.<\/p>\n<p>Back
        one month later, Harazi was exhausted and worried. Knowing that nothing could
        be done, his conclusions were the same. The kingdom''s elite knew that civil
        war was but a few weeks away, and that it would be followed by a starvation.
        But Harazi came up with a solution (that was forced by the government). He
        would go to each city and village, and cast a spell on the water reserves
        that would decrease people''s hunger and calm them down.<\/p>\n<h3>Aftermath<\/h3>\n<p>Seeing
        the chaos in the cities of people attacking others, all non elfes were banned
        from the kingdom. Later, it was revealed that Harazi had tampered the water
        treatment spell and was blamed for the chaos and aftermath. His legacy was
        tarnished, and he was forced into seclusion ever since.<\/p>\n<p>All in all,
        170''000 thousand Elves and half-elves were killed, 200''000 non-elves, and
        450''000 surviving non-elves were forced out of the kingdom.<\/p>\n","image":null,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"image_full":null,"image_thumb":"https:\/\/kanka.io\/images\/defaults\/patreon\/events_thumb.png","has_custom_image":false,"header_full":"","has_custom_header":false,"is_private":false,"is_template":false,"entity_id":12142,"tags":[],"created_at":"2018-04-04T09:49:11.000000Z","created_by":null,"updated_at":"2021-02-11T15:51:58.000000Z","updated_by":null,"location_id":5125,"type":"Civil
